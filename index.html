    Hi, my name is Madison Draper. I'm a senior at UC Berkeley, double majoring in Geography and American Studies/Urban Planning. I'm interested in expanding cartographic representation across web and static platforms for education and research purposes. Of course, I still have a lot to learn, so here's a record of what I know and I want to learn! My current projects are a danke blog, BlackLandscapesMatter Atlas and a thesis on the evolution of food urbanity. Danke f√ºrs Lesen.

    <b>11 November 2017.</b> When I tell people that I'm fascinated by maps, they kind of look at me funny, like who could be so obsessed with Google's half capitalism-half geo-laved data maps--or even perhaps worse--Apple's awkward navigation stage? If you're familiar only with this navigation-based sort of map, keep on reading. There's serveral types of maps, ranging from napkin sketches to GIS analysis projects.
    <ul>Mental Maps: These are the maps we use everyday. From getting around your apartment, to getting to work, to picking up milk on the way home. You just know your way around, it seems. You could sketch this out with a bunch of lines (likely not to scale) on your breakfast napkin explaining to a tourist how to get to the market.</ul>
    <ul>Reference Maps: These are your navigation maps that tell you where you physically are or where you're trying to go. The ubiquitious Google and Apple Maps and transit maps are all reference maps. I actually find these maps the most interesting because they're taken to be the less biased maps, but there's a lot of decisions that go into cartography and with that a lot of power. More on this later. </ul>
    <ul>Topographic Maps: These beauties inform people about the physical geography and geomorphology of a place. These are 3D representations of hills and topographic changes on 2D maps. Earth in your pocket.</ul>
    <ul>Thematic Maps: These maps expose correlation of a phenomena and its spatial distribution. Basically, what are we looking and where are they. The first recognized GIS map is John Snow's map that correlated water wells and Cholera deaths.</ul>
    <ul>Isarithmic Maps: Also commonly known as Heat Maps, these maps show the density of phenomena that is generally over an area. Typical Isarithmic maps are weather maps.</ul>
    <ul>Dot Maps: These maps emphasise certain locations on a map. These can list places, as well as expose spatial densities. </ul>
    <ul>Cartograms: These maps are especially visually interesting because land area is distorted by the density of a phenomena. The greater the density, the more surface area.</ul>
    <ul>Art Maps: Maps are as much art as they are spatial intelligence and geometry. ARtistic maps can look a lot more like art than they do like maps, thus it takes careful observation to notice the direct these maps are going. (Sorry for such a bad pun, I sorta tried).</ul>
    This incomplete list of maps is just a pixel of what more maps behold than getting somewhere. Maps are so much more about where you are. Maps tell you about a place, coming from a narrator. Maps are socially and culturally constructed as much as they are technogically. When looking at a map, ask questions and have constant vigilence.

    <b>10 November 2017. </b>For my third attempt at keeping a blog, here's what I intend to write about: data-visualization, cartographic-representation, coding and probably weird-things-my-dogs-do. Posts will be #tagged, but the tag may just be for ctrl+f functioning for now. Lasst uns anfangen.
    <br></br>
    I'm teaching myself how to code, and it is the most challenging and rewarding experience. I'm privileged to be in a university with such a developed EECS program and to be in a position to understand our system. With that, I've created this sort of quasi-virtual bootcamp for myself. Results are starting to show. My game plan is to go through the 61 series (structure and interpretation; data structures; computer architecture/machine structures) by the start of next term. This will give me a foundation of what computer science abstractly and somewhat practically as I struggle through the projects. So far, I'm a almost to the middle of my journey with a few more months to go. I've learned a lot about structure and writing coherent--not just functional--programs. Writing something that is humanly fathomable couldn't be stressed more. <i>Side note, coding alone is so hard and way less fun.</i> But anyway, when I return to Berkeley is when the gears really start moving. I'm going to audit a ton of CS courses, namely CS 160 UX Design, CS 161 Security, CS 162 Operating Systems, CS 164 Programming Languages, 169 Softwarre Engineering, CS 170 Algorithms and 186 Database Systems. That's twice the amount a computer science <i>major</i> would take. But hey, I'm being really, <i>really</i> ambituous here. And practically speaking, I'm not even trying to come out of this experience with godly coding skills. Instead, I want to learn about what there is to learn about--that sort of abstract knowledge to delve deeper and see what is even possible.
