    Hi, my name is Madison Draper. I'm a senior at UC Berkeley, double majoring in Geography and American Studies/Urban Planning. I'm interested in expanding cartographic representation across web and static platforms for educational and research purposes. Of course, I still have a lot to learn, so here's a record of what I know and what I want to learn! My current projects are a danke blog, BlackLandscapesMatter Atlas and a thesis on the evolution of food urbanity. Danke fürs Lesen.

    <b>14 November 2017.</b> Sometimes, I want to (gently) shut my laptop and just give up. Those thoughts of, “I’m never going to get this”, “Why am I still trying this” and my personal favourite “What if I did something else with my life instead?” Sometimes, this sort of panic is a good jolt and healthy amount of pressure for me to put on myself. But for the past 4 hours I have been staring back and forth between the assignment details and my extremely barren code. I’m supposed to make unit tests, but I’m at the point where I’m just now understanding what parts of my code I’m even supposed to be testing. It’s frustrating, sometimes even heartbreaking. I don’t know what’s worse: your code failing the tests forever or just a blank void of a screen. Let me tell you that they’re both intimidating and discouraging, but this is the time to really start chugging. I scrapped everything. <i>ctrl+a, delete.</i> Done, gone. It’s time to start over. After I finish this self-pep talk, I’m going to write it out in plain English and worry about implementation later. It’s important that I can communicate (to myself especially for understanding purposes) what I’m doing exactly. I’m going to figure this out.

    <b>13 Nobember 2017.</b> My dog (pictured top right, named Tapatio) found the cat’s water bowl today. He stuck his head in and started to blow bubbles. Later in the day, I filled up his water bowl. He dunked his head in. He didn’t even open his mouth.

    <b>12 November 2017.</b> I want to talk about the process of map design today, primarily theoretically but also quite practically. A quintessential mistake of map readers is often the assumption that maps contain everything the way a photograph would. In no way should that fault be theirs, however. In reality, maps are a graphic representations and interpretations of the world. They are crafted through a process of selection and symbolisation. If a map were to have everything that a photograph does, it would be overwhelming and extremely cluttered, making it difficult to read and understand. If you’re wondering the importance of clarity and nothing is more clear to you than the captured reality of a photograph, think about navigation maps. While you’re driving, it’s incredibly important for maps to be succinct and fully understood at quick glances. Most people don’t stare at maps to try to understand their message, so we have to make the message explicit. Map design is a process 5 P’s of planning, perspective of data, presentation, proofreading and production. Instead of explaining each process, let me ask you some questions about each. This will be more beneficial as different purposed maps are going to ask different questions, but these questions will help guide you towards the questions you should be asking yourself.
    <ul><i>Planning</i>. What am I going to map? Where does this phenomena occur? What’s the context? Who is the audience? Why am I mapping this? What would readers gain from looking at this? What story am I telling? What message is being understood?</ul>
    <ul><i>Perspective of Data.</i> Where did this data come from? How did this source collect its data? Was the methodology sound and fair? What biases does this data show? How does this data tell a story? Why is this data important to someone else?</ul>
    <ul><i>Presentation.</i> Do I want to make this map’s medium be print or web? What are the benefits of one over the other? Could it be both? What projection shows the least amount of distortion for this message? Is the data being conveyed with a certain bias? At what scale is the story most clear? What colours are intuitive to readers, coincide with the theme and look aesthetically pleasing? What symbolisations are intuitive to readers, coincide with the theme and look aesthetically pleasing? Is the weight of this map evenly distributed? Is the story still clear? How can it improve? Perhaps re-ask the planning questions once the presentation is drafted.</ul>
    <ul><i>Proofreading.</i> Is this my best work? Are any symbols that look to similar? Does their size make them hard to read, or do they overlap any other important information? Are the boundaries clear? Does it need text to explain anything? Is it weighted well? Is the story clear? Is the story clear to someone else? Is citation present?</ul>
    <ul><i>Production.</i> What context is surrounding this map? Does the story of the map and story of the context compliment each other? How could this map be produced? Do I have the copywriter information correct prior to release? Once placed in print or web, will the map keep the dimensions it was created with? If not, is there disruption in the legibility? Is this my best work?</ul>
    Of course these lists of questions aren’t exhaustive, in many ways they’re to guide you to ask critical questions about your specific maps. A few of these concepts may seem more like social or philosophical context. I think that a lot of people making web maps now are trained more heavily in software or graphic design, and less in geography. Geography’s core themes are essential for creating the right context for your map. I’ll go into these more philosophical concepts later, like scale v. zoom. Never forget the basics!

    <b>11 November 2017.</b> When I tell people that I'm fascinated by maps, they kind of look at me funny, like who could be so obsessed with Google's half capitalism-half geo-laved data maps--or even perhaps worse--Apple's awkward navigation stage? If you're familiar only with this navigation-based sort of map, keep on reading. There's serveral types of maps, ranging from napkin sketches to GIS analysis projects.
    <ul>Mental Maps: These are the maps we use everyday. From getting around your apartment, to getting to work, to picking up milk on the way home. You just know your way around, it seems. You could sketch this out with a bunch of lines (likely not to scale) on your breakfast napkin explaining to a tourist how to get to the market.</ul>
    <ul>Reference Maps: These are your navigation maps that tell you where you physically are or where you're trying to go. The ubiquitious Google and Apple Maps and transit maps are all reference maps. I actually find these maps the most interesting because they're taken to be the less biased maps, but there's a lot of decisions that go into cartography and with that a lot of power. More on this later. </ul>
    <ul>Topographic Maps: These beauties inform people about the physical geography and geomorphology of a place. These are 3D representations of hills and topographic changes on 2D maps. Earth in your pocket.</ul>
    <ul>Thematic Maps: These maps expose correlation of a phenomena and its spatial distribution. Basically, what are we looking and where are they. The first recognized GIS map is John Snow's map that correlated water wells and Cholera deaths.</ul>
    <ul>Choropleth Maps: Areas on this map are typically shaded alonga gradient that is symbolic of the density of a phenomena. A common example are population maps.</ul>
    <ul>Isarithmic Maps: Also commonly known as Heat Maps, these maps show the density of phenomena that is generally over an area. Typical Isarithmic maps are weather maps.</ul>
    <ul>Dot Maps: These maps emphasise certain locations on a map. These can list places, as well as expose spatial densities. </ul>
    <ul>Cartograms: These maps are especially visually interesting because land area is distorted by the density of a phenomena. The greater the density, the more surface area.</ul>
    <ul>Art Maps: Maps are as much art as they are spatial intelligence and geometry. ARtistic maps can look a lot more like art than they do like maps, thus it takes careful observation to notice the direct these maps are going. (Sorry for such a bad pun, I sorta tried).</ul>
    This incomplete list of maps is just a pixel of what more maps behold than getting somewhere. Maps are so much more about where you are. Maps tell you about a place, coming from a narrator. Maps are socially and culturally constructed as much as they are technogically. When looking at a map, ask questions and have constant vigilence.

    <b>10 November 2017. </b>For my third attempt at keeping a blog, here's what I intend to write about: data-visualization, cartographic-representation, coding and probably weird-things-my-dogs-do. Posts will be #tagged, but the tag may just be for ctrl+f functioning for now. Lasst uns anfangen.
    <br></br>
    I'm teaching myself how to code, and it is the most challenging and rewarding experience. I'm privileged to be in a university with such a developed EECS program and to be in a position to understand our system. With that, I've created this sort of quasi-virtual bootcamp for myself. Results are starting to show. My game plan is to go through the 61 series (structure and interpretation; data structures; computer architecture/machine structures) by the start of next term. This will give me a foundation of what computer science abstractly and somewhat practically as I struggle through the projects. So far, I'm a almost to the middle of my journey with a few more months to go. I've learned a lot about structure and writing coherent--not just functional--programs. Writing something that is humanly fathomable couldn't be stressed more. <i>Side note, coding alone is so hard and way less fun.</i> But anyway, when I return to Berkeley is when the gears really start moving. I'm going to audit a ton of CS courses, namely CS 160 UX Design, CS 161 Security, CS 162 Operating Systems, CS 164 Programming Languages, 169 Softwarre Engineering, CS 170 Algorithms and 186 Database Systems. That's twice the amount a computer science <i>major</i> would take. But hey, I'm being really, <i>really</i> ambituous here. And practically speaking, I'm not even trying to come out of this experience with godly coding skills. Instead, I want to learn about what there is to learn about--that sort of abstract knowledge to delve deeper and see what is even possible.
