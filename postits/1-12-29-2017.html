	When I went to elementary school, there were 180 days of the yearthat we'd attend. I recall the most exciting day being the 100th day of school for no particular reason except for it being the hundreth day. Because of breaks and the occasional 3 day weekend, this day was never even guaranteed to be a Friday. But it was a truly celebrated day.

    I have been miserably inconsistent with my blog's current state, posting only when it's convenient. However, that it isn't the point of doing this. So, I am asking for a restart. I aim to write everyday for 100 daysâ€”no bullshit posts either. Likely my posts will revolve around the topics it has thus far: cartographic thought, webmapping, urbanism, coding projects and more personal expositories. I want to write this as a way to collect my thoughts and express them in a way that is typically unorthodox to their nature. People don't often have lengthy explainations to maps because the point of a map for many people is purely interpretated visually. So allow me to try and write this out and communicate maps through a different lense.

    All code for this can be found on this <a href="https://github.com/madizhen/Personal">repo</a>. The naming style will differ slightly just to help differentiate what posts belong to the 100. I refrained from gamifying this experience because I believe that the fruits of this will be self-evident. Though as far as punishments for missing a day? Let me end this inagural post by saying I recieved the perfect attendance award in elementary school every year. <i>Shall we?</i>
