	"He should move the compass from the right side to the left side," the boy in the front seat suggested.
	<br></br>
	My professor—looking slightly annoyed & certainly witty—said, "Hold on,'right' side? And 'left' side? That's a map, what directions are you talking about?"
	<br></br>
	That was probably the funniest joke I heard all semester. This happened in my cartography class. You went in front of the room with your map projected behind you, & you could either get a silent praise of approvement from everyone or you could get destroyed. I suppose humilation still motivates us quite well. But this post is about map design, not about the pressures we induce to carry society.

    When I tell people I'm a cartographer or "into maps," they typically respond with a polite yet confused "Cool" or with evergreen curiosity—<i>"Doesn't Google Maps already exist?"</i>. It is startly because of institutions like Google Maps & Apple Maps that I've grown so passionate about maps. People don't know the world well outside of their personal relationships to it, making maps everymore important because they become the image & understanding people have of the world. <a href="https://twitter.com/thotfulmami/status/891171272935211009">A classic example</a>. Though I'm really hoping the example is a joke, you can see how easily maps become our understanding of the world.

    This <a href="https://madizhen.github.io/Personal/postits/12112017.html">post</a> foreshadows this post's aspects of map design, as it revolves around the initial steps of just thinking about your map. It's sort of a mind map, if you will. I recommend it as a good read before we go into details about what makes up the visual experiences of a map.

    Map design shares many principles from its broader discipline: design. However, there is one cardinal difference between the two. Design has a bit more liberty to be creative, and while maps may still be creative, they have to be truthful & fully representitive of its spatial bounds. The meaning behind maps is to shed light on a niche of an actual reality. And with the many, many facets of society & environment, its awfully hard to put on a single map. So let's start our composition.
    <br></br>

    <ul><b>Theme.</b> It would be overwhelming to map every detail of a space, so <a href="https://madizhen.github.io/Personal/postits/11112017.html">maps tend to focus on a certain aspect</a>. To start a map, we ought to start with a theme of what we're ever going to map.</ul>

    <ul><b>Orientation.</b> There are a plethora of map projections that people have made in attempt to satisfy our visual understanding with the math behind representing an unstable geoid. Google adopted the Mercator Projection, and so did the world. If we're doing a static map, then we can tilt the select area in a way that is more truthful to its position on the hemisphere or it can be placed in a way that allows more room on the page for accessory details. The select area is the focal point of your map—many people might not read a single word of anything on the map, so the way we convey this part really counts. It ought to take up the most real estate on the page, often in the visual center. If the map is going to be cluttered with text or images, consider emphasising the select area with drop shadows or bolding its borders to provide more contrast & even supiority. It is also important to provide a sense of place to contextualise where your select area is. Ways to do this is to add surrouding areas or insert a small globe & box the location.</ul>

    <ul><b>Title.</b> If people read any words on your map, it will likely be the title. The medium of delivery will dictate whether the map title should be placed directly on the map or below in a caption. For the sake of creativity, let's put it on the map. There are three important things to consider: wording, placement & type style. The wording introduces someone to your map and its content. If its a professional map, consider being factual, like "Population of African-Americans in The City of San Francisco by Neighbourhood." Next, the placement of the title does not have to be at the top of the page, but it does have to stand out over all other text. Sounds like a fair trade, no? The select area will affect the placement. The main concern is that the design flows together nicely & looks legible. The type style will also depend on the context of your map: professional or creative. Professional fonts will be Arial or some easy to read seriff. But creative titles will likely be more visually engaging and match the style of the map.</ul>

    <ul><b>Legends.</b> These deal with many of the same problems as the title: wording, style, placement & content as well. The legend does not to need to claim it self by saying "Legend," for its functionality should be sufficient. The words in your content out to be concise yet descriptive enough to fit appropiately. The amount of space you have and its placement will be governed by the amount of white space you have after placing the select area. The styling doesn't have to match exactly, but it ought to at least compliment for aesthetics. Contrasting fonts will detract from the map itself. The content of the map completely depends on what is being mapped. If it's a choropleth map, then a small sample of the colours in a conceivable fashion & their accompanying meaning will be great. If the legend is depecting icons, keep the icons the same size as they are on the map to avoid confusion.</ul>

    <ul><b>Scale.</b> Scale is the level of depth of your select area. When mapping the world or countries, it is often not critical to put a scale because that can be too much to comprehend anyway, but for smaller areas it helps a person orient themselves and understand the data as well. Scale can be visualised as a line segment that depicts a measurement on the map in relation to actual milage. The same scenario could be represented as a ratio or verbally—"one inch represents one mile." Though the placement of a scale is often decided by the amount of white space, it is better to put it near the seelct area for legibility & better comprehension.</ul>

    <ul><b>Insert Maps & Supplemental Material.</b> An insert map was briefly mentioned above as a way to contextualise where the map is representing in the world. Supplemental material encompasses aspects like text, sourcing, a compass rose, images & so forth. Both of these elements should be placed in a way that looks composed—don't forget the Rule of Thirds if confused. When deciding to add these to your map, constantly ask how it's beneificial and if it's the most beneifical thing you can add.</ul>

    <ul><b>Boarders.</b> There is much debate about the necessity of neat lines and frames. Some believe that they add stability, while others believe they are too constricting and therefore unrealistic. I suggest adding them and seeing if you like the style or not. It usually doesn't hurt to try.</ul>

    This wasn't an exhaustive list of parts of a map to consider, but they are the fairly ubiquitious ones that will help in the overall composition. The overerlapping themes of wording, placement and style can easily be applied to any other aspect you're interested in adding to your map. Happy mapping, and always remember to know your direction.
