	This morning, I read a friend-from-college's first blog post. I really liked him in the semester we were close; he was very confident in his attitude, but not as much in his ability. His first post expressed his personality perfectly, it was well-written and had serious content about reflecting through his college experience, but in a voice that was so familiar it was like I could hear him speaking to me. Throughout the day I've been thinking about what I was going to write today and how I was going to write it. Though I never really came up with a definitive topic, I can't help but think about reflections quite broadly. In design, reflections bring symmetry and broadens what is already there. In the abstract, reflections dig deep into your core. Or maybe you should be digging deep into your core to reflection. In either case, an abstract reflection requires the development of thought and process of understanding of oneself and the situation or environbment. It could even be said that in the abstract and in the world of design, reflections are meant to broaden your horizons. Maybe it's taking the time to think about something other than what's next that makes reflecting so powerful. For a few minutes, we can just sit and digest what's happened before we're thrown into another vortex of information and decisions. When reflecting, you've really got to look not only see. (It's kinda like the differnce between listening and hearing, I suppose.) I'll aim to make every 10th post a reflective piece.

	So while this post is about reflecting, where is <i>the</i> reflection? Well, there isn't really one, sort of. I  believe all narratives have at least some personal reflection. While I may have only ranted here, I stand by what I've written in saying that reflecting is crucial to understanding oneself and one's environment.
