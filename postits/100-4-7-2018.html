	It has been 100 days since I sought out to write a post a day. It has been quite a journey. It was easier than I thought, but also quite difficult and time consuming every time the clock struck eleven. They say it takes 60 days to form a habit, and this certiantly feels habitual now (I might even try to keep it up!). I learned more than I thought I would because I pushed myself to write something of interest. Though there were many times where I wrote posts poor in quality, I those were times where I was really out living with my friends and family. This string of posts will always be available for me to look back on what I have learned and symbolic of how much more I have to learn.

    Will I be doing something like this again? Certiantly. But I don't think I'll be writing blogs posts so much as I will be adding comments in code. I like that approach because I feel lke other people can learn from it to. While I was teaching myself how to code, well comments in code were among the fewest resources available. So check out for that soon!

    This blog will remain fairly active, and I'll do my best to update and reflect upon whatever comes. I think the act of writing and articulating defining the boundaries of what I've learned helps to solidify such. So, until next time!
