	 For my third attempt at keeping a blog, here's what I intend to write about: data-visualization, cartographic-representation, coding and probably weird-things-my-dogs-do. Posts will be #tagged, but the tag may just be for ctrl+f functioning for now. Lasst uns anfangen.

    I'm teaching myself how to code, and it is the most challenging and rewarding experience. I'm privileged to be in a university with such a developed EECS program and to be in a position to understand our system. With that, I've created this sort of quasi-virtual bootcamp for myself. Results are starting to show. My game plan is to go through the 61 series (structure and interpretation; data structures; computer architecture/machine structures) by the start of next term. This will give me a foundation of what computer science abstractly and somewhat practically as I struggle through the projects. So far, I'm a almost to the middle of my journey with a few more months to go. I've learned a lot about structure and writing coherent--not just functional--programs. Writing something that is humanly fathomable couldn't be stressed more. <i>Side note, coding alone is so hard and way less fun.</i> But anyway, when I return to Berkeley is when the gears really start moving. I'm going to audit a ton of CS courses, namely CS 160 UX Design, CS 161 Security, CS 162 Operating Systems, CS 164 Programming Languages, 169 Softwarre Engineering, CS 170 Algorithms and 186 Database Systems. That's twice the amount a computer science <i>major</i> would take. But hey, I'm being really, <i>really</i> ambituous here. And practically speaking, I'm not even trying to come out of this experience with godly coding skills. Instead, I want to learn about what there is to learn about--that sort of abstract knowledge to delve deeper and see what is even possible.
