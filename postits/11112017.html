 When I tell people that I'm fascinated by maps, they kind of look at me funny, like who could be so obsessed with Google's half capitalism-half geo-laved data maps--or even perhaps worse--Apple's awkward navigation stage? If you're familiar only with this navigation-based sort of map, keep on reading. There's serveral types of maps, ranging from napkin sketches to GIS analysis projects.
    <ul>Mental Maps: These are the maps we use everyday. From getting around your apartment, to getting to work, to picking up milk on the way home. You just know your way around, it seems. You could sketch this out with a bunch of lines (likely not to scale) on your breakfast napkin explaining to a tourist how to get to the market.</ul>
    <ul>Reference Maps: These are your navigation maps that tell you where you physically are or where you're trying to go. The ubiquitious Google and Apple Maps and transit maps are all reference maps. I actually find these maps the most interesting because they're taken to be the less biased maps, but there's a lot of decisions that go into cartography and with that a lot of power. More on this later. </ul>
    <ul>Topographic Maps: These beauties inform people about the physical geography and geomorphology of a place. These are 3D representations of hills and topographic changes on 2D maps. Earth in your pocket.</ul>
    <ul>Thematic Maps: These maps expose correlation of a phenomena and its spatial distribution. Basically, what are we looking and where are they. The first recognized GIS map is John Snow's map that correlated water wells and Cholera deaths.</ul>
    <ul>Isarithmic Maps: Also commonly known as Heat Maps, these maps show the density of phenomena that is generally over an area. Typical Isarithmic maps are weather maps.</ul>
    <ul>Dot Maps: These maps emphasise certain locations on a map. These can list places, as well as expose spatial densities. </ul>
    <ul>Cartograms: These maps are especially visually interesting because land area is distorted by the density of a phenomena. The greater the density, the more surface area.</ul>
    <ul>Art Maps: Maps are as much art as they are spatial intelligence and geometry. ARtistic maps can look a lot more like art than they do like maps, thus it takes careful observation to notice the direct these maps are going. (Sorry for such a bad pun, I sorta tried).</ul>
    This incomplete list of maps is just a pixel of what more maps behold than getting somewhere. Maps are so much more about where you are. Maps tell you about a place, coming from a narrator. Maps are socially and culturally constructed as much as they are technogically. When looking at a map, ask questions and have constant vigilence.
