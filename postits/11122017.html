		<b>Tastes Like Home</b>

		There is this idea that the contents of one’s refrigerator or pantry is the most indicative spot in the house to ethnic origins. Being the only Chinese-American in a white household in a white suburban neighborhood of La Mesa, that never really held true for me. Halfway through high school, I joined a community service club, where I met new friends who came from Vietnamese-immigrant families. Their parents were gracious enough to invite me to their home-cooked dinners and were a mix of thrilled and confused when I said I was a vegetarian. Though I am not Vietnamese, this was my first introduction to “real Asian” food. Although being a vegetarian can be difficult with new types of cuisines, it was somewhat easier in realms with Buddhist morals. We frequented various rice dishes, phở and my favourite, a sandwich called bánh mì. Bánh mì is not a meal I ate at my house, but it did make me feel as though I was home.

 		The French colonised Vietnam in 1887, bringing their language, culture and food, including the baguette. One could call bánh mì a “Vietnamese appropriation of the baguette,” as they mixed both “rice flour with the wheat flour…to make it fluffier than the French baguette” with a crispy outside to compliment the crunchy vegetables, aromatic herbs and silky meats inside (Lam). Initially, bánh mì was a street food that fed the working class in Vietnam (Lam). However, the turning point in bánh mì production and consumption aligns with the Fall of Saigon in 1975, thereafter Vietnamese refugees immigrated to the United States, opening a new market.

		With US “foodie culture” and “ethnic” food affinity, bánh mì popularity escalated through food trucks and Vietnamese restaurants around Santa Clara and Little Saigon in Orange County. <i>What actually makes something authentic? Is it the people who make it, the origin of the ingredients, the preparation practices or perhaps it is all of it?</i> But it did not take long before these “authentic” family-owned hole-in-the-wall shops started to face the competition of commercial restaurants with corporate capital and the mind to “adjust”—or more often appropriate—the sandwich’s recipe. For example, Yum! Incorporated, owner of chains like Taco Bell and KFC, opened Banh Shop, where they westernised bánh mì by adding Korean meat and their own dipping sauce “Pho Jus” that is “not something you’ll see or experience in other Vietnamese restaurants,” rather food ambiguously—and likely financially—“inspired by their [supposed] roots of our French and Vietnamese heritage” (Banh Shop). About half of their menu options have the word “Vietnamese” in either the title or description, as if signalling validation and authenticity. Andrea Nguyen believes they are doing this to appear “familiar, friendly and smart” (Nguyen). <i>What makes something appropriation? Is it the westernization of the recipes, is it using “Vietnamese” as linguistic marketing and not as accreditation, is it accumulating capital while the actual creators remain in poverty or perhaps it is all of it?</i>

		I lived in Berkeley, California for the past three years for university. It was the first time I was emerged into a place with an Asian majority, overwhelmingly Chinese with an accommodating Chinese restaurant landscape; the Vietnamese flavours my taste buds indulged were scarce. So, I began to make bánh mì at home for myself and my friends; it was something I took with me. I’m Chinese, but I’m just making what my Vietnamese-friends made for me—is this appropriation? Though I prepare it in ways my friends’ parents taught—not online, fusion recipes—maybe I still am appropriating. But I do hope by sharing bánh mì of “traditional” recipes, it can be interpreted as an act of resilience against bánh mì’s westernisation. Bánh mì is not a food of <i>my culture</i>, but it is a food of <i>my identity</i> because it serves as a nexus between new and old friends, their families, myself and a taste of an Asian-American culture. The last part is especially significant because it finally introduced me to an identity, culture and experience specific to Asian-Americans that was absent from my childhood, as none of my family or friends were Asian. Though I acknowledge the problems of a ubiquitous “pan-Asian” identity, I think that it was important for me as an adolescent to have at least met people who looked similar to me. Though the original geographies of bánh mì and I are not similar, bánh mì allowed me to connect to a greater community of friends and cultures.
