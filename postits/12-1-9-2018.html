	Ahhh, I don't have much to say today because my dog is hurt! I did say that some of my posts would be about my dogs, so let me introduce them. I have three male rescue dogs with very distinct personalities.

	<ul>Bosley is a nine year old pittbull mix. At over ninety pounds, he's kind of fat, but we're working on it. He likes to jump up to give you kisses. His hobby is to roll around in the dirt on his back.</ul>

	<ul>Tucker is a year-and-ten month Australian Cattle Dog. He's got a beautiful black, grey and white coat that makes him look like a silver fox. He's incredibly focused and loves to play fetch more than anything in his life. We once played fetch for so long that he threw up, but right after he finished he brought the ball back to play again.</ul>

	<ul>Tapatio is a ten month terrior, poodle (probably) and schnauzer (also probably) mix. He's the funniest guy ever. He's a collector who steals all the toys and hides them in places too far for the other dogs to get. He blows bubbles in the cats' water bowl. He grabs Tucker by the tail when they play fetch; why run fast when Tucker can just pull him?</ul>

	Tucker was playing catch today and jumped too high and fell on the hard tile floow. He hurt is back leg and can't walk on it. Sorry for the short and abrupt topic, but I've got to take care of my dogs!
