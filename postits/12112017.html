	 I want to talk about the process of map design today, primarily theoretically but also quite practically. A quintessential mistake of map readers is often the assumption that maps contain everything the way a photograph would. In no way should that fault be theirs, however. In reality, maps are a graphic representations and interpretations of the world. They are crafted through a process of selection and symbolisation. If a map were to have everything that a photograph does, it would be overwhelming and extremely cluttered, making it difficult to read and understand. If you’re wondering the importance of clarity and nothing is more clear to you than the captured reality of a photograph, think about navigation maps. While you’re driving, it’s incredibly important for maps to be succinct and fully understood at quick glances. Most people don’t stare at maps to try to understand their message, so we have to make the message explicit. Map design is a process 5 P’s of planning, perspective of data, presentation, proofreading and production. Instead of explaining each process, let me ask you some questions about each. This will be more beneficial as different purposed maps are going to ask different questions, but these questions will help guide you towards the questions you should be asking yourself.

    <ul><i>Planning</i>. What am I going to map? Where does this phenomena occur? What’s the context? Who is the audience? Why am I mapping this? What would readers gain from looking at this? What story am I telling? What message is being understood?</ul>

    <ul><i>Perspective of Data.</i> Where did this data come from? How did this source collect its data? Was the methodology sound and fair? What biases does this data show? How does this data tell a story? Why is this data important to someone else?</ul>

    <ul><i>Presentation.</i> Do I want to make this map’s medium be print or web? What are the benefits of one over the other? Could it be both? What projection shows the least amount of distortion for this message? Is the data being conveyed with a certain bias? At what scale is the story most clear? What colours are intuitive to readers, coincide with the theme and look aesthetically pleasing? What symbolisations are intuitive to readers, coincide with the theme and look aesthetically pleasing? Is the weight of this map evenly distributed? Is the story still clear? How can it improve? Perhaps re-ask the planning questions once the presentation is drafted.</ul>

    <ul><i>Proofreading.</i> Is this my best work? Are any symbols that look to similar? Does their size make them hard to read, or do they overlap any other important information? Are the boundaries clear? Does it need text to explain anything? Is it weighted well? Is the story clear? Is the story clear to someone else? Is citation present?</ul>

    <ul><i>Production.</i> What context is surrounding this map? Does the story of the map and story of the context compliment each other? How could this map be produced? Do I have the copywriter information correct prior to release? Once placed in print or web, will the map keep the dimensions it was created with? If not, is there disruption in the legibility? Is this my best work?</ul>

    Of course these lists of questions aren’t exhaustive, in many ways they’re to guide you to ask critical questions about your specific maps. A few of these concepts may seem more like social or philosophical context. I think that a lot of people making web maps now are trained more heavily in software or graphic design, and less in geography. Geography’s core themes are essential for creating the right context for your map. I’ll go into these more philosophical concepts later, like scale v. zoom. Never forget the basics!
