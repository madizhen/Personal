	In a few hours, I'll be on a flight back to Berkeley, California to complete my final semester at university. I'll be moving away from San Diego for likely the last time. For the past 6 months I've been living at home to take care of my dad and mom. It has been a time full of sadness and of joy, I am so glad that I moved back. This time has matured me and showed what I truly value in life.

	<br></br>

	So I titled this moving because I'm physically moving, but also because I feel an overall shift, or movement, in my personality and values from just a few months before. I will put effort in the activities that fascinate me; I will chase after knowledge I never thought attainable; I will nurture the relationships I have with the people I love. 

	<br></br>

	I will certianly start to write more interesting and engaging posts once I am back in an environment that is geared towards such. Let's start tomorrow.
