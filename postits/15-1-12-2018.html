	<i>Let me explain. I wrote a post last night, but I chose not to post it because of its more personal nature. Yesterday was the first day my mom is on her own, and that's something I just couldn't express freely. So forgive me because you won't see all 100 posts, but also please understand why. From here on, topics will likely be much more light-hearted and increasingly technical as school progresses anyway.</i>

	If you're familiar with JavaScript, you've likely used or written JSON files for AJAx purposes. GeoJSONs are similar to JSON, but it's purposefully for encoding geographic data structures through specific geometry types: <code>Point</code>, <code>LineString</code>, <code>Polygon</code>, <code>Multipoint</code>, <code>MultiLineString</code> and <code>MultiPolygon</code>. It also supports non-spatial elements of geographic data with <code>Feature</code> and sets of features called <code>FeatureCollection</code>. It can be used by various mapping software and GIS packages.

	<ul><code>Point</code> and <code>MultiPoint</code> are used for addresses and exact locations.<br>
	<code>{"type": "Point", "coordinates": [10,10]}</code>
	<code>{"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [ [0, 0], [5, 5], [10,10]}</code></ul>

	<ul><code>LineString</code> and <code>MultiLineString</code> are used for streets, interstates and boundaries.<br>
	<code>{"type": "LineString", "coordiantes": [ [0,0], [1, 1], [2, 2] ]}</code>
	<code>{"type": "MultiLineString", "coordiantes": [ [[0,0], [1, 1]], [[2, 2], [3, 3]] ]}</code></ul>

	<ul><code>Polygon</code> and <code>MultiPolyon</code> are used for politically bounded surface areas, land types or land formations. <code>Polygon</code> can also be used as an interrelated set. An example would be if you were mapping the ocean, but when you come across an island you wouldn't map that as water.<br><br>
	<code>{ "type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [ [[0, 0], [0, 2], [2, 2], [2, 0] ]]}</code><br>
	<code>{ "type": "Polygon", "cooridinates": [ [[35, 10], [45, 45], [15, 40], [10, 20], [35, 10]], [[20, 30], [35, 35], [30, 20], [20, 30]] ]}</code><br>
	<code>{ "type": "MultiPolygon", "coordinates": [ [ [[30, 20], [45, 40], [10, 40], [30, 20]] ], [ [[15, 5], [40, 10], [10, 20], [5, 10], [15, 5]] ] ] }</code>
