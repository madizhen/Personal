	How do you define a city centre? Is it a geographical centre determined by the distance between the boundaries? Or is the epicentre of social and financial interaction? How are these places designed differently? If these places are considered more liveable to a degree, than why not have more city centres? Or maybe the centre is an abstract concept, a fantasy even. Maybe there is nothing centre-like about these places as the name suggests, maybe its more of a marketing name to gather people to the hub.

	I like to think of the Bay Area especially with this concept. Regionally, when considering the centre, most people if not everyone will tell you that San Francisco is the centre. San Francisco has been dubbed The City because of it's concentric importance to the region. Though it's arguable that it's the most urban feeling place in the suburban area, but it has close competitors, like Oakland. Going deeper into San Francisco, what is the city centre of this? There's Civic Centre, which includes many local government buildings and offices. But there also exists a City Centre, which is a shopping area. Neither of these locations are that geographically centre either. Whatever we are to make of this concept is something I want to explore for my senior honours thesis. I'll let update you as it materialises.
