	"Raster is faster, but vector is more correcter," read the slides of my intro to web mapping course from a couple years back.

	Raster data is a pixelised data format in a gridded structure. Each pixel has the same size and shape, but varies in its value for colour information. Cons of raster images include blurring with elargement and the large file size needed. An example of a raster graphic may be a 1" x 1" square with 100 dpi, meaning that there are 100 individual pieces of information. A common type of raster uninvolved in mapping is photographs. Although, in remote sensing, raster data is collected. These files comine in file formats like .jpeg, .png, .tiff, .gif and so on.

	Vector graphics use mathmatical relationships between points to draw points, lines and curves. Unlike the 1" x 1" raster square graphic, a vector is four points that are connected by calculations. The file size can also be smaller because it only needs to store the connecting points. Vector graphics are infinitely scalable, meaning that a change in size won't cause distortions or blurs. Common vector graphics include fonts and logos.
