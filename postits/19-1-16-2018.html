	Today was my first day of my last semester of undergrad, or my last first day of undergrad if we really want to get sentimental. The software engineering class I was looking forward to was canceled, the user interfaces class was postponed until Thursday, Databases Systems was hilarious, Security was fantastic and Architecture was just right. Tomorrow I'm looking forward to my Geographic Information Analysis, starting my theses work and Data Structures. I love school. <i>I love school.</i> I'm really trying to make the most out of this semester both academically and socially.

	I didn't learn a whole lot today, but I can talk on some of the security concepts we went over in security. We started off with Threat Models. There's an odd simultaneous anxiety and satisfaction in security where things don't have to be absolutely perfect, but they do have to be good enough to withstand threats from predicted attackers. Security is a process of assessing and prioritising strategies for risk management. Consider questions like what are management likely forms of attack and what are common methods that have happened previously. We also learned about a common, classic buffer called Memory Safe. This dealt with the amount of memory an input reserves and expects. I liked her teaching style in that the professor went showed a basic function for hacking an airplane ticket program and had us keep raising the defence. With her example, there was 80 bits allowed for characters and we had to deal with the problems of a hacker making the length either too short or too long. If it was too short, it would mess up a later value. If it was too long, it would reloop through its counter back at zero.

	I look forward to these next few months!
