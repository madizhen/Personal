	When first approaching the construction of a new program, where do you begin? There are a few different frameworks that have been developed to work build a program.

	<ul><b>Plan and Document.</b> This methodology works best in large business hierarchies. First, the Project Manager makes a plan. With the plan, construe detailed documentation for all phases of the plan. Progress is then measured against the plan's timeline. If there are significant changes, then they ought to be reflected in the documentation for proper track keeping and records. If impactful enough, changes may even alter the direct of the plan, and thus ought to be recorded in the plan as well. The downfall of this approach is that it has low flexibility for setbacks, scaling changes and consumer priority adjustments.</ul>

	<ul><b>Waterfall.</b> This style requires depth of analysis and specifications. With sufficient data, the architectural design of the program can commence. Once the program has been built, it undergoes a prototyping process of implementation and integration for critiquing. Next, there's a level of verification and validation for approval. After deployment, there remains a level of maintenance to keep the program updated.</ul>

	<ul><b>Rational Unified Process.</b> The inaugural step is inception, setting a schedule and budget. Similar to previous frameworks, the next step to begin designing use cases, software architecture and prototypes, called Elaboration. The Construction is a debugging step that runs the code through a series of tests. Finally, the Transition puts the product in a real environment.</ul>

	<ul><b>Agile.</b> This framework begins with user stories through individuals and their interactions. The construction of software begins. Before shipping the product, customer collaboration reintervenes to assure that everything is working the way it ought to. These programs should be made to be sensitive and responsive to change. It's a form of Extreme Programming that has short iterations, undergoes a Test Driven Development and writes in the simplest form. During each iteration, it revisits every step.<ul>
