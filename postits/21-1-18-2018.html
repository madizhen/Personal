	A database is a set of relations, in which elements can be accessed and retrieved for review. Databases are organised into a table structure or a series of table structures because of their intuitiveness and because of the data's ability to be mapped out in a clear, concise and consistent format. Tables can also be referred to as Relations, which are comprised of Schema and an Instance that are constructed with attributes (columns) and tuples (rows). Schema are fixed descriptions of unique names of an atomic type. Primary keys are unique identifiers If you think of Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, there's a numerical list on the y-axis that helps you keep track of where you are in the document and what row your data is referencing. Foreign keys reference a table and do not have to be part of the primary key.

	To communicate with databases, different languages can be used depending on the scaffolding you're approaching. The common convention is SQL (either s-q-l or sequel). This is a relatively straightforward language, meaning that instead of you telling the program how to behave, it has preinstalled methods that you call to interact with databases.

	<code>
	phone_book<br>
	id | name | phone<br>
	-----------------<br>
	 00 |  John  | 510<br>
	 -----------------<br>
	 01 |  Lily | 619<br>
	 </code>

	 Let's practice basic SQL with the table above. To get an element, type <code> SELECT < attribute > FROM < table_name >;</code>. Let's take it up a notch. To find John's phone number, what would you type? There's a lot of books and online resources to learn SQL, try to figure out the answer! Good luck!
