	<i>Yesterday's post was a cop-out, I fully admit. But let me debrief here.</i>

	<br></br>

	I finished my first week of the last semester of my undergraduate degree to-be. I've started this semester feeling capable of everything I've set to accomplish. I was ready to undertake two honours theses, intern for an upper-division cartography course, develop an upper-division web-cartography course, audit four computer science courses, begin recruiting and, of course, have a social life. I'll be the first to admit that I'm overwhelmed internally. It's difficult just to prioritise what to do: if I don't do my thesis work, I won't be degree-ready for employment, but if I don't get better at programming, then I won't be employed anyway. It's a typical cycle of decision, but I'm human and struggling with it no matter how redundant the process. 

	<br></br>

	Don't get me wrong, I am <i>ecstatic</i> that I even have the opportunity to do half of these projects. Reflecting, I'm proud that I've worked hard enough to make it into two honours programmes, that my professor thinks highly enough of me to appoint me as an intern and develop a class with her, that I've got the tenacity and self-discipline to sit through these courses and try my best, and I'm most grateful that I've got a set of friends to hang out with. I'm blessed to be in these situations, and I have no intentions of letting anyone down or lowering any of my own standards. I've just got to work harder and be better. This semester, I don't just want to grow, I want to flourish. This is the most independent school has ever asked me to be, and while help from graduate students and professors is graciously evergreen, I want to take all of this upon myself and test just what my limits are as an academic. 

	<br></br>

	Although I was technically still going to school last semester at SDSU, I took less classes and was certainly not immersed the way I am at Berkeley. It's almost like being a freshman again, living on my own and being fully responsible for all decisions. I like it though, getting a second go at this crucial phase of growing up is important. Equipped from previous experiences and eager for new beginnings, I invite the challenges ahead.
