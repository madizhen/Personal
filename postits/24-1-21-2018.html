	<i>Plans change more frequently than we'd like to admit. So often are we caught up in where we want to be, seldom do we make know how to act when presented with changes in the plan.</i>

	I've been working on Treehouse tracks daily to learn more practical coding skills. Don't get me wrong, I <i>love</i> the theoretical side that Berkeley has been putting on it so far, but I've also got to balance it in a way that I can put things together. Having done some of Berkeley's more abstract work first was a good way to start. I feel like those concepts are hardly mentioned in online resources, let alone gone into depth. I stared learning ES6 earlier today. I don't know if it's the structure of the course or if I just haven't gotten deep enough yet. I was planning on writing a much more detailed post about what I've learned, but like I said plans change. It's important to be flexible in situations. What happened today wasn't anything I foresaw, but it was something I was glad to take time for, even if it was just a messenger. Regarding relations, there are few things more important than communication. Hopefully tomorrow I'll be able to tell you all about ES6.
