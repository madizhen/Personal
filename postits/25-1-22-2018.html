	The first law of geography states that everything is related, but nearer objects are more related. This begs the question of what are the bounds of nearer: are they spatial, are they crafted interaction, are they aspects of both? With globalisation, the defining boundaries have blurred and likely lean towards some combination of physical distance and communicative relations. It's been argued that with technology's advancement that one could work professionally anywhere in the world. But is that true? If it were the case, why have such dense clusters of offices in places like the Bay Area, New York City or Washington DC? If the theory of the cloud's remote working capability is true and people have the flexibility to be wherever they want, then why do companies still create headquarters and, more importantly, why do people come to work in these places? In the past few decades our world has been retrofitted for convenience and, in many cases, social isolation. So why when we have the option to work at our convenience and in a place we are most comfortable, do we instead actively seek grandiose offices, urban epicentres and, most of all, other people? I'm not arguing that people are anti-social by nature, because they're not. But I'm considering that new technologies have favoured door delivery instead of shopping malls, food delivery or take-out instead of dining, texting instead of calling, so forth. And quite prominently, all of these can be done with few taps on a personal cell phone. Technology has promoted our introvert, but at the expense of our familiarity with the physical world and its inhabitants. Back to the main question then, if we have isolated ourselves so much, why do we crave to live in places of high density, low affordability and questionable convenience?

	While I'm not yet prepared to answer my own loaded questions, I'm trying to figure it out. I've been reading urbanists' cases for a desire of diversity in the backgrounds of people, the social structures and the physical environment. So in addition to figuring out the top half of why people still come together, let's investigate the how those three aspects of diversity interrelate. To scale it down, I'm eager to examine the software engineering culture of the Bay Area and the very different city spaces of San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose (broadly encompassing Sunnyvale, Cupertino, etc). I'll update any conclusions I have to these open-ended questions at another iteration.
