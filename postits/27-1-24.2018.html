	Regarding my post from a couple of days ago, I still don't have answers to the broad questions of why we have exchanged social isolation aspects of our life for convenient aspects; however, I'm starting to piece together how this has even happened and why we keep spiraling through this. My ideas and questions have been a combination of analyses of Richard Florida, Jane Jacobs and James Vance.

	<br></br>

	The flow goes something like the following few statements. Cities attract people, who attract more people, who attract companies, who mimic cities. More specifically, cities attract people, sepcifically Creative people that are highly educated (and also highly wealthy in order to afford these areas), technologically inclined and have open minds. People have concentrated in cities of millions of people with various points of view and intersecting identites. Companies have chased after these brilliant people to create and work for them. By recreating the best parts of the city's culture and amenities, the company has created a place of fantasy. By combining the city's atmosphere and the companies' reimagined office, these creative people have been immersed in a fantasy which ought to be futher explored.

	What is it about these places are attracting a population that has induldged in conveince? I hypothesize that the city's culture is what draws these Creative workers, and then the companies have learned from the city's design and culture by reflecting the two ideals in the interior designs of their offices.

	When asking this we also have to ask what attracts people to other people? All of the aforementioned authors mentioned the importance of trust and belonging in the community. They believe there ought to be a cohesitivity to the people and neighbourhoods in order to create a livable, trustworthy and happier city. Jacobs talks about this idea at large through the physical designs of the street and the neighbourhood. Florida argues that this is a purely social contract between people who seek intellectual benefit and social acceptance from the community. Vance affirms the psychological aspect in which people seek social interaction for validity in their beliefs and identities. But aside from social benefits, is the clustering of people beneficial elsewhere? Shortly, yes. The benefits are economic, as these people contend and debate their work, cross ideas and relate to one another, there is a constant stream of intellect being nutured amongst the community and thus the companies that inhibit the area and employ the evergreen minds.
