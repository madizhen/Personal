	Yesterday I thought I'd take a break from learning JavaScript to pick up something new: Android. Like most new things, it was daunting and confusing, and I wanted to go back to quasi-unpredictable yet comfortable JavaScript. I got stared by downloading <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html"> Android Studio</a>, which is also produced by the same company that made IntelliJ. So if you're used to IntelliJ, then Android Studio won't be nearly as overwhelming at first because the conventions are basically the same--especially if you write your Android programs in Java. The methods can be coded in either Java or Koltin, and you can design either using XML, Design or a combination of the two.

	I was just getting used to it, so I haven't made anything worth explaining yet. I'll be working on it some more this weekend and will try to make a tutorial out of what I build. But here's some good resources that I've got bookmarked to get started.

	<ul><a href="https://developer.android.com/samples/index.html">Android's Documentation | Code Samples</a></ul>
	<ul><a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/intro/index.html">Android Studio's Documentation</a></ul>
	<ul><a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/android/10-2/sample-code/">ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Android</a></ul>

	Once you've made your program, you can run it either on your Android phone or through an emulator. Android Studio has anticipated this and comes with an emulator built in. I would recommend trying to run the emulator before selecting the size of the screen your working on just so everything fits the way you see it in Design.
