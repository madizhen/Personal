	The first time I started coding, I had no idea what I'm doing. I took a AP Computer Science in high school. I famailised myself with things like "Array" and "Dictionary" in the language Java. But after high school, I dropped computer science for more political ambitions in college. Even though I have ended up with computer-based ambitions, I harbour no regrets about what I chose to major in.
	<br></br>
	About a year ago, I decided to pick up computer science again. I started on various free coding sites, like codeacademy and NodeSchool. But when I compared what I was doing to actual projects, I defintely felt Imposter Syndrome overwhelm me. So I decided to learn from the ground up. If I wanted to be like my CS major friends, I had to earn it.
	<br></br>
	I started with the course Computer Science 61A: The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. It's the introductory course to the CS major at Cal that introduces major topics and concepts in computer science. It's mostly in Python, with bits of Scheme and SQL. The first tool I started to use was <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python3</a>. Python is an object-oriented program. I like to think of actual objects with specific attributes that can be associated with it to best contextualise what's going on in the program. For example, bank accounts are a great way to think about it, but more on that in another post. Aside from function definition, the first thing reviewed was Environment Diagrams. These are particularily helpful to understand what you're code is doing and what happens during each part of the code.
	The initial function or functions comprise the Global or Parent Frame. That function binds to the function value in that current frame. For example if you had:
	<blockquote>
	<code>
	def add_one(x):
	</code>
	<code>
	<blockquote>y = x + 1 <br></br> return y
	</code> 
	</blockquote>
	</blockquote>
	then your global frame would have <code>add</code> pointing to <code>func add(x, y)</code> and have a place value for <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> and the <code>return value</code>. However, if you have multiple functions, then the Global Frame will be all the functions pointing to their function, and the subsequent functions will be the specifics of the functions. This can be a little difficult to understand without visuals, so I encourage <a href="http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit">this site</a> to visualise what's going on with programs. It's definitly a difficult thing to do at first and even a bit tedious to draw and redraw, but it's worth udnerstanding and working through.
