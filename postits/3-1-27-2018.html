	According to Florida’s Creativity Index Rank [footnote methodology], the top ten regions of creativity are San Francisco, Austin, Boston, San Diego, Seattle, Raleigh-Durham, Houston, Washington-Baltimore, New York and tied for tenth place is Dallas and Minneapolis-St. Paul (Florida, RCC, 246). These metropolises are the ultra-creative cities he refers to as Creative Centers, which have “high concentrations of Creative Class people, ... high concentrations of creative economic outcomes” and are a well “integrated ecosystem…[for] all forms of creativity--artistic and cultural, technological and economic--can take root and flourish” (Florida, CCC, 35). In Florida’s top ten list, the climate--regarding both meteorology and state politics--is unpolarised, so there has to be another luring factor to investigate. The answer is simple, these people are not particularly attracted to a place so much as they are to each other. It is self-defining creativity that attracts members of the Creative Class to seek out other Creatives for interaction, validation, belonging and maybe even competition. These centers evoke the “abundant high-quality experiences, … openness to diversity of all kinds and the opportunity to validate their identities as creative people” (Florida, CCC, 36). The emphasis of all of this is that members of the Creative Class are not seeking a place so much as they are seeking each other and ways to spend quality time with each other.

	Though there are several accounts of overflows, it is important to remember the Creative Class does not occupy the entirety of a region or even a city; rather, they cluster towards what I have critiqued Florida’s Creative Center to a scaled down rendition that I call Creative Epicenters. I choose to apply “epicenter” because it can be broadly defined as the surface point of a phenomenon. During earthquakes, the epicenter experiences the most change from the tension release, while near places are less affected as they radiate away from the epicenter. The geomorphological principle can be seen to hold true in the context of cities, neighbourhoods and streets. A city is a large place that is mixed heavily with the (privileged) creative workers, service workers and homeless. The Creative Class does not occupy the entire city, nor are some of these spaces where they even want to be. Instead, they cluster in these Creative Epicenters that have been catered towards their preferences. In order to examine them, it is most conceivable to view from a smaller scale typically bounded in a neighborhood or even a single street. The difference when traversing just one block to five blocks away from the epicenter is drastic and noticeable in nearly all aspects, such as economic activity, building type, architectural style, lighting, crosswalk formality, transit stations and parking availability. Since the Creative Class has the capital and desire to live or at least consistently visit these places, they play a large role in shaping the atmosphere cultural and design of the area. This smaller scale focus on Creative Epicenters permits analysis of change within a neighbourhood and ultimately a city, making it easier to predict new gentrification spots, transit route efficiency, economic opportunities and so forth. Similarly, this is also a crucial way to study the preferences of the Creative Class. Therefore, the study of the Creative Epicenter’s is invaluable to the city planner and the office manager.
