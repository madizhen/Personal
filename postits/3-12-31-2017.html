	Two-thousand and seventeen has been the most memorable year of my life, and I'm not just saying that because this is the most recent year. Reflecting, I have many things to celebrate this year, like learning from some of my role models, learning how to code, being in the best physical shape, spending time with my family, raising a puppy or two, learning to cook real food, reading books cover to cover & maybe even falling in love a little. I have spent as much time as possible living well & happily. I have learned so much about the things I want to do and the path to steadfast in order to do so. But moreso, I have enjoyed the time I've spent with those that I love. Simultaneously, I have great tragedies to mourn over, like the cancer battle and eventual death of my dad. While I want to reflect sincerly on this year, I think I'd rather do it with a cheap bottle of wine and some great friends instead of typing it out by myself. I apologise that this post is modest in length, but please understand. Happy New Year!
