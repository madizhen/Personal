	I told myself I'd start applying to jobs and graduate school in March. For a while, that seemed like forever away and that I could get everything done and still have time to enjoy my senior year. As the first week of February nears closure, I'm incredibly stressed out at my lack of preparation. I'm cognisant that there are days my supposedly tech-focused learning blog suffers with my rants (like today) about not being able to meet the deadlines I've set for myself. <i>When will you raise your ambitions to meet my standards?</i> I've got that quote written down everywhere to motivate me to work harder, but I think my productivity efficiency and self-management has plateaued and now it's just that there's so much more for me to learn and not nearly enough time.
	<br></br>

	I've readjusted some parts of my original plan, but here's basically my day-to-day and overarching projects.

	<code> <br></br>

	try { <br>
	&nbsp Wake up at 7:00 am to watch a CS lecture <br>
	&nbsp Go to class or study until about 2:00 pm <br>
	&nbsp Have an amazing kale salad for lunch <br>
	&nbsp Study until it's dark <br>
	&nbsp Cook dinner with my amazing roommate <br>
	&nbsp Study until around 2:00 am <br>
	} catch (noClass) { <br>
	    &nbsp &nbsp madison.goTo(library); <br>
	} catch (extremeleyMentallyTired) { <br>
		&nbsp &nbsp madison.goTo(gym); //rarely <br>
	} catch (tiredOfDebugging) { <br>
		&nbsp &nbsp madison.study(urban_thesis); <br>
	} catch (tiredOfThesis) { <br>
		&nbsp &nbsp madison.study(programing) <br>
	}

	<br></br></code>

	This is my everyday. Weekends look the same just minus class. I don't think I'm getting tired of it so much as I'm just overwhelemed about employment or the lack there of. Here's what I've been doing to improve my programming base.

	<ul>Auditing the following courses: User Interfaces, Data Structures, Database Systems, Software Engineering, Security, Geospatial Information Analysis, Ruby on Rails DeCal</ul>
	<ul>Going through <a href="teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a>, <a href="https://javascript30.com/">JavaScript30</a> and newly  <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/map">FreeCodeCamp</a>.</ul>
	<ul>Less frequently, I'm poking at Mapbox, Carto and Unity.</ul>

	I partially wrote this out so that I keep myself accountable to keep going at it. I think in the next few weeks I'm going to try the #100DaysOfCode challenge because with all this lecture auditing, I feel like my understanding of programming is very conceptual and abstract. As important as that is for architecting reliable, scalable and secure code, I'm realistically not going to get employed if I can't practically code.
