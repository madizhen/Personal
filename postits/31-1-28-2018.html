	Node.js is an open source environment for executing server-side applications. (Node.js doesn't direct you to a particular JavaScript file, rather it's the name of the product.) It's helped JavaScript become a ubiquitous language around the web for both client and server side. This makes starting both easier and harder. Easier because you can do so much with only one language; difficult because of the asynchronous nature of JavaScript. (For now, take the word 'asynchronous' to mean that things happen at real speed and not just the order you write or select them in. I'm sure you can already foresee how beneficial that could be and also how much of a headache.)

	One of the best thing about the programming language is the open and welcoming community who is eager to help. The philosophy of open source software has been crux to the building of many modern programs, applications and frameworks. If you're new to learning how to program, and you feel absolutely overwhelmed by the amount of resources there are, do not worry. You are certainly not alone--as I'm sure you already noticed with the amount of information you saw. I've been self-learning for a little over a year, and I'm in awe at something new every single day. Luckily, most of this scaffolding is free and there are several types of teaching (videos, walk throughs, blogs, tutorials, etc) to cater towards your learning style. Also, documentation is fully available online, though that can be too daunting and technical at first. Additionally, many veterans of this community has posted their projects for you to learn from on popular sites, like Github (like this site!) and npm. Let's talk about npm for a second.

	<br></br>

	If you go to the <a href="npmjs.com">npm website</a>, you'll see on the top left corner that it's a random string of words that just start with n, p and m. (Currently, mine says "Nicely Printed Maps" and it couldn't be fitting). Npm originally stood for Node Package Manager, but now it can also contain package for other languages--the lingo just stuck. These packages have pre-written code to help you throughout your programming learning and career. In another post (likely tomorrow), I'll go over how to select the right package and an example of how to use it.
