	Going off of yesterday's post, the coding community can be very welcoming to young programmers. We talked briefly about weird things called npm packages as a black box that can basically do things. Let's delve a little deeper into what these are exactly.

	Npm packages contain pre-existing code, so you don't have reinvent the wheel so to speak. A good starting point to see what's available to you is the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm website</a>. (An account is free to make if necessary). Consider the following when looking for a package:

	<ul>Popularity. While popularity isn't everything, it is a good indicator of broad usage, frequent testing and scaffolding to help you learn it.</ul>
	<ul>Version Number and Number of Releases.The more releases, the more active. It's also important to view the date and frequency of intervals. Under the name, you can also see if the package is passing the tests.</ul>
	<ul>Github. Sometimes the Github repo can be more popular than the npm website. Also, the owner might update the repo more than the npm site, so watch out for that.</ul>

	This npm package called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server">http-server</a> is a great tool to understand, test and deploy locally. It has easy (zero) set up and can be run on the command line.

	To install, open the terminal and write <code>npm install http-server -g</code>. The <code>-g</code> flag means that you're installing it globally and giving it the ability to be run from the command line.

	To run, you'll first create an <code>index.html</code> file inside of a folder. You may fill your static web page with whatever you like. Once you have that saved in a folder, type <code>http-server [folder name]</code>. It should print out a message like this:

	<br></br> <code>
	Starting up http-server, serving [folder_name]/<br>
	Available on:<br>
	http://127.0.0.1:8080<br>
	http://10.103.160.249:8080<br>
	Hit CTRL-C to stop the server
	</code> <br></br>

	What do all these numbers mean? The first set <code>127.0.0.1</code> is a default IP address on all computers. The <code>8080</code> is the default port. You can flag <code>-p</code> to adjust the port.

	<br></br>

	Hope this helped as a starting off point to npm!
