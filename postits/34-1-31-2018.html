	I've been prepping for recruiting for the past few months by diving into code and trying to self-reflect on something everyday. After looking over several tech resumes, design porfolios and personal website blogs, I've noticed the value in a "paper" trail. ("Paper" because it's obviously not paper.) But with sites like Github that track and display your activity really put an importance on consisteny. I recognise that creating that base is important as a medium to express hard work and dedication most of all. But I also see it as something that can be very discouraging when comparing to an experienced person or when just starting out. Or when not posting projects. I work on coding every day, but I stopped posting on Github. I don't know, maybe I'm just stressed about upcoming recruitment.
