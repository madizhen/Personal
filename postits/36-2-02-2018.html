	A singular word can have the multiple definitions. Take the word "centre" for example. The mathematical definition is where all points along the circumference are equidistant from the center. In other words, it isn't really about the center as a point, but much more about its context. Conversely, the "centre" is spoken colloquially it refers very strongly to the node being discussed. This change in definition is much more than meaning because it relies on context in order to provide an orientation.
