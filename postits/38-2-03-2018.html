	My family and I live on a sloped hill, but it flattens out a little near halfway up the street. Our closest neighbours lived there--we actually used to live directly across the street from them instead of on the slope. When I was eight years old, my dad taught me how to ride a bike. My dad took off the training wheels, held on while I started peddling and gave me a big push before he set me off. I wobbled and I jerked the handle bars left then right, trying to keep my balance. I fell, he caught, we tried again--despite my refusal and pleas for the training wheels. We tried again.

	<br></br>

	Every few years, my parents got me a new bike for Christmas. My bikes were always black and red, which was definitely the coolest combination. The street I lived on was perfect with a large flat area and a hill that wasn't too bad. It was incredible, in fact. It's bizarre, it was so difficult learning how to ride on, but once I got it, there was nothing more exhilarating than riding down my street's hill.

	<br></br>

	As much as I rode some, others collected dust in the garage. Looking back, I took this for granted. I don't know why I didn't want to ride my bicycle everyday. My parents noticed, and I stopped getting bicycles even though I was still growing. In high school, I had a sudden resurgence to ride a bicycle, but I was already too tall for mine and just a little too short for my mom's. But I rode it anyway, for hours I rode around not just my street, but the whole neighbourhood. I explored places that I had never even been before. I saw people I knew and others that I'd never meet again. It became a new sort of thrill. But still, this didn't last long.

	<br></br>

	Now, at nearly twenty-two years old, all I want to do is ride a bike. I want to speed down from my apartment to the marina. I want to weave around the park, staring at the trees while I should be watching the road. I want to ride a bicycle, care to join?
