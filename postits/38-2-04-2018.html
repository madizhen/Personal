	Before I find the solution, I find the problem. That's my rule of thumb when approaching how to design something--from code to a paper to a stack of legos. The laborious process of tearing something apart to find a new way to put it back together is among the most challenging, frustrating and rewarding tasks. Yet even after the problem (likely problems) has been identified, how does one even start to put something back together without it being what it just was? Design--whether it be architecting code or actual architecture--has framework processes that guide a team of designers through collaboration and revision.

	Iterative Design is a cycle that allows designers the opportunity to thoroughly research, prototype and evaluate for change. The cycle involves crucial steps like brainstorming, researching, designing, redesigning, engineering re-engineering, evaluate, redesign, sales and redesigning based off sales. Though that may have been verbose, this framework is particularly useful because of the amount of iterations the designer or designers do before deployment. Each step also has its own careful construction of sub-steps. The dynamic and process also changes with the team size, time-frame and budget. This framework is also quite similar to the Agile software development framework, which involves heavy customer collaboration, the ability to respond to change and a constant prototyping for critiquing.

	At renown design company IDEO, they design in a way that is organised and human-centered. The brainstorming mantra is to: Aim for quality, hope for quality. They see this as the best way to consider various possibilities, grow off each other and collaborate. They mark ideas by number instead of by person to diminish emotional attachment or bias. There's a process of building and jumping that is difficult to navigate switching, but also remember in this stage ou are completely free to return to previous ideas. The research phase goes beyond just reading statistics and hearing anecdotes. It involves in-person observation. This allows the designer to view every step and reaction the person has while engaging with the interface. More so, the designer can also witness effects the environment may have, if applicable.

	The recursiveness of the redesigning is important and ought to be handled by situation, so I won't go far into that. However, the ways to approach critiquing is vital for teamwork and product deployment. For larger groups, it may be a good option to break into smaller groups to focus on certain aspects of the design or create two different designs to be combined later on. In this stage, having a person that asks for input is crux for conversation flow and design progress. In order to take a more dispassionate stance, it may be better to offer 2 to 5 designs instead of just one, for the one might get attacked to harshly.

	Design is tough. Design for change. Change design. Do it all over again.
