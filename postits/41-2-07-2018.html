	<i>Disclaimer: I've only sat through three or four lectures on cryptography, but this is so cool that I have to try to synthesise it.</i>

	In an earlier post, I discussed Symmetric Key Cryptography as a formal defense against an attacker. In that model, Alice and Bob share a secret key to encrypt and decrypt their messages from attackers. In Asymmetric Key Cryptography Alice ad Bob have their own respective public and secret keys. Let's refer to Alice's secret key as SKa and her public as PKa; let's refer to Bob's secret key as SKb and his public key as PKb; for the attacker, Eve, let's refer to her secret key as SKe ad her public key as PKe. The principle that Eve is knowledgeable about the structure of the algorithm and the public keys, but does not know either of the secret keys. Alice and Bob can encrypt using their public key, but can only decrypt using the secret key.

	Because Alice and Bob don't know each other's private keys, they have to pass them through a One Way Function. The logic goes as follows. If given x, it's easy to compute f(x). Yet if given value y, then it is considerably harder to find any value x such that f(x) = y. It's incredibly difficult because mathematically, this is cannot be computer in polynomial time.

	Now, an example structure of the an algorithm that uses asymmetric keys is called the Diffie Hillman Key Exchange. Alice and Bob are chatting over a network and Eve is trying to infiltrate their messages. Alice sent a message encrypted with SKa, Bob receives the message but cannot decrypt it with only his key SKb. Alice cannot send a message that isn't encrypted because it'd be too easy for Eve to read or overwrite. What are they going to do? When Bob receives the SKa encrypted message, Bob will encrypt it too with SKb and send it back to Alice. Eve, who doesn't know either SKa or SKb will be unable to intercept the message, so Alice will receive it. Alice decrypts SKa on the message and sends it back to Bob with only the SKb encryption. Eve still cannot see the message. Bob will receive the same message (we've only had one message being written and sent this whole time!) that is only encrypted with SKb, which he can unlock.
