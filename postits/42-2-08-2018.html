	Earlier this week was one of my busiest days interning in the cartography lab. Nearly all of these students hadn't built a map by themselves with ArcGIS until just then. Though they did one before in class, it was a walk through and didn't involve any data shuffling. This time, they got to drive: making decisions, cleaning data, the world was literally theirs. If you've ever used platforms like QGIS or ESRI's ArchGIS, you know how unreliable the system is and how unpredictable some functions can be. The array of 30 odd students got both of it. Instead of just spending and hour in lab, I was there for nearly three hours, talking to students individually about what was going on.

	Trouble shooting with them was so much fun, but it made me question my teaching style, especially with platforms as tremendous as ArcGIS. Personally, I'm a pretty introverted person, and I speak a lot louder through doing than I do through speaking. I'm very comfortable with ArcGIS, but I have a spatial relationship of each item, so I'm very unaware of where icons are or sometimes even what to do if I'm not controlling what's going on. That said, even though I was teaching, I did a lot of the upfront driving on the software. I saw later in the class that my professor never touches the computer unless the student has reached the danger zone--even then, she does a good job of pulling them back up to the surface. I remember reading somewhere--I think in a blog post from Mapbox--about one of the rules of thumb while teaching is to let the learner do all the driving. One girl was nearing the danger zone with her project, and I was driving (like really fast, too). I remember apologising for going off course to steer her away from the danger zone. Completely lost, she responded with, "No, go for it; I'm learning so much just watching you. How long have you been doing this?" As much as I appreciate the compliment of my ability, that is definitely not what you want to hear as a teacher. The point is for the student to have grasped the concept and practice, right? Right.

	Shortly after she asked that, I shifted my stance--verbally and physically. Verbally, I stopped telling her what to do, and I started giving her options. I think this was a great method because it allowed her to think about what could be done and then figure out what was best for her situation and skill level. This was an extremely important turn in our conversation because I stopped just telling her what I would do and then how to do it, and I let her ask the tough questions about GIS. The most thought provoking part of GIS isn't how to use the software, it's about how to arrange and clean the data in a conceivable manner. Once we were on the same page about what to do, it because a matter of physical body language. The physical aspect might actually be even more important than the verbal. Who is holding the mouse can already tell you a lot about the situation. Am I learning over and pointing at everything, critically watching her every move? Not anymore, that adds way too much pressure to a new user who could easily feel discouraged. Instead, remain upright and watch carefully without pressuring them--allow them to stay focused on their work.

	<br></br>

	In summary, I learned a lot the other day about teaching people how to use software. In particular, I've pointed out two crucial stances to take (or not take?) when teaching. Upon further reflect, I intend on implementing this for the rest of the semester. I look forward to updating you on how it goes and how much more they progress.
