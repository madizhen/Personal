	I've mentioned earlier that I'm enrolling myself through various online coding programmes and courses. As I'm nearing the end of Treehouse's Fullstack JavaScript, I've started diving into FreeCodeCamp. Before these courses, I've also completed UC Berkeley courses, codacademy and AP CS. I'm not unfamiliar with coding, but I'm constantly starting new programmes that start at or near the beginning. I feel a false sense of progress as I zoom through the first half without a sweat. So why do I keep doing this?

	<br></br>

	I don't really know. But I think it has something to do with an obsession with the basics. Practice doesn't make perfect, it makes permanent. So every time I start a new programme, I try to go in thinking that I'll get the most out of it by going through each piece. It's impossible to memorise documentation, and it's completely unfair to expect that a programme could teach every part of the language or framework. Similarly, different teachers have different conventions. I love picking up these kinds of tricks and tips. Additionally, a lot of programmes teach you by building small projects, and as I wrote before, the construction and design of a project--even if it's only a few lines long--still goes through a series of decisions. Even though I'm comfortable declaring variables and even writing my own programs, I'll gladly humble myself in front of introductory work. It only takes a few seconds, but I value the return quite highly.

	<br></br>

	Basically, I'm a sucker for the basics.
