	I haven't much new to write since I've been reviewing basics and only having a go a logic puzzles in preparation of the larger projects this site awaits. I know a few of my more recent posts have been less tech teaching and much more of my own aggravations with learning tech. Like I said, the amount that I learn this month is highly crucial, as I start applying in March. So back to the basics, I'm really trying hard to have that completely mastered, so I can start building more elaborate projects to show once I (very hopefully) start hearing back. I've got this all planned out--sort of.

	<br></br>

	Instead of ranting onwards and making this post like the others, I want it to be more of a tribute to those--both friends and online programmes--who have been crux to ability to learn code. Also, since I'm not yet at a position to donate money towards the incredible open-source software that has allowed me to learn, explore and grow, perhaps there is someone who reads this and will come across your incredible scaffolding. I'll put these in the order that I frequent them, but I'd say the top three occupy about 98% of my programming time.

	<ul><b>UC Berkeley's Computer Science Courses | Free/Limited</b> If you're not affiliated with UC Berkeley, you can only get the full experience of the freshmen-level introduction to the major course: 61A Structure and Interpretations of Computer Programs. This course is incredibly well structured and goes through concepts on a deep and abstract level. It doesn't just teach you how to code, it teaches you had to code well. While it's mostly in Python, it goes into Scheme and SQL near the latter sections. The labs and homeworks are focused on repetition and might be pretty boring for most people, but the projects are full of useful scaffolding and certainty challenging enough. The lectures for courses after this are locked for non-UCB students; however, almost every course runs either off of their own website of Github. So you can still get most materials and work on your own. But for practical programming, this isn't the bets resource. My personal goal is to gain a deeper understanding of what and why I'm doing this, then supplement the coding part with the following resources.</ul>

	<ul><b>Treehouse | $25/month</b> This has been a fantastic mixture of explanatory videos, complementary quizzes, applicable coding practices and the practical projects that you go through throughout the mini-series. The organisation is also probably the best around. It gives you the options of selecting a track to get an overall understanding of the capabilities of the language. I like that a some tracks integrate more than one language because that's much more practical to learn how they work together. For supplementary material, quick mini-workshop series or if you're starting at a more intermediate level, the individual classes are a good place. They cover a lot, which makes it very long and difficult to get through sometimes. But overall I'm satisfied!</ul>

	<ul><b>freeCodeCamp | Free!</b> This is a great resource. I've done around half of the Front End and a few sections of Back End. The challenges are all single paged, so you get a sense of instant-gratification that encourages you to keep going. (I did nearly 150 challenges yesterday without even noticing.) That said, it's best if you have experience with programming before starting this because it doesn't really teach you too many concepts so much as it does how to do things. If you're looking for gaining practical skills and project building, this is great.</ul>

	<ul><b>nodeschool.io | Free!</b> This is an amazing community and programme series to help get you started with JavaScript. It can definitely be on the more difficult side, but the environment presents itself in a way that makes you learn how to use your computer also. I feel like a lot of programmes shelter you from the command line, but nodeschool is reliant on it.</ul>

	<ul><b>Leaflet, npm, Medium, Mapbox, etc | Free!</b> I don't even know if these count because they're not teaching you how to code as much as they are tools for coding. Either way, they all present great documentation and packages to learn a lot from. I use these much more than everything below, so it'd feel wrong if I didn't pay tribute.</ul>

	<ul><b>SoloLearn | Free!</b> This is a mobile application that I like because it's an extremely bite-sized way to review. I've only used JavaScript/jQuery and Python on it so far, but there's also C++, HTML/CSS, php, SQL, Java, Swift, C# and Ruby. The mobility is the absolute best, plus there's a huge active community to help explain problems in more detail. I've never tried it on the desktop, but the platform is the same, just larger It does explain concepts, but somewhat shortly and if you learn poorly just by reading, then it might present itself more difficult than its worth. Great for review, but wouldn't learn on it.</ul>

	<ul><b>Code School | Free/Limited</b> I like the format a lot, they use themes for their courses to make you feel like you're progressing through a journey. It's a good gamification of coding--is there really a better way to teach coding? I was originally between making an account for either this or Treehose. I chose to hold off on making this account because I read several reviews that said this one had a larger, more advanced library for JavaScript. Because of that, I wanted to get a solid grasp on it with Treehouse, then sign up for Code School later. So who knows, maybe this will replace Treehouse soon!</ul>

	<ul><b> CodeNewbie Podcast | Free!</b> I only just discovered this adjunct project of freeCodeCamp, but just by glazing over the topics, I think this podcast asks and answers all the questions that new coders are shot-down on Stack Overflow for being "too broad."</ul>

	<ul><b>Eloquent JavaScript | Free!</b> If you're more of a book learner and enjoy wholesome reads with funny stories, this is the way to go. It's completely free and interactive online. I only stopped using it because as far as learning code goes, I prefer building over reading.</ul>

	<ul><b>codecademy | Free/Limited</b> I think this site is good for learning syntax, but otherwise I don't spend like any time on it. Because of this, I haven't touched it in almost a year, so perhaps it's upgraded!</ul>

	There's a few more in my bookmarked Code folder that I'm not going to mention because I haven't gotten far enough into them for a sufficient report. But I'll still give honorable mention to to those I'll be looking at soon: The Odin Project, Flatiron's Bootcamp Prep and (broadly) AWS.
