	As I've been working through various programmes, I've noticed that almost all of them rely on bite-sized information and instant gratification projects. This is a great way to keep a user engaged, but an almost awful way to really learn programming. I've gone through hundreds of hours of material, just to be "too tired" to build the lone projects they ask for. <i>The problem isn't that I don't know what to do (or at least how to figure it out), but it's that I don't want to do it. Why go through these small projects, when I could better spend my time learning new things and adding to me repertoire?</i> That mindset is what makes the graduates of these various programmes fail when they're by themselves. I'm writing about this because I started experiencing it these past couple of days. Nearly half of freeCodeCamp is just giving you a project to write by yourself, which is totally boring if you're doing the programme alone. So what do you do?

	<br></br>

	I'm a double humanities/social science major, so I've spent probably 80% of my academic time in college reading and only about 20% actually writing--5% of which is dedicated to actually writing and the other 15% to editing. From talking to my CS major friends and reading various Medium blogs, programmers say similar things. Most of their time is allocated towards research and design than it is to actually writing code. Sometimes, this 20% can take up 120% of your mental energy and leave you dissatisfied, unfinished and exhausted. So what do we do?

	<br></br>

	I get it: writing code might be less time but that doesn't always (and sometimes if ever) mean it's easier. If you're unfamiliar with the language, it could take way longer, and with an insane amount of documentation to read through, the problem only worsens. So the fatigue definitely still happens--frequently mind you. So here's how I'm approaching this problem of fatigue.

	<ul><b>Starting small.</b> For these prgrammes, I'm starting small. Like, really small. Today I worked on two programmes: a python task list (god forbid) and a dungeon game. They were both able to be finished within less than an hour. It was almost painless. The definition of 'small' will vary across coding levels, so don't overwhelm or underwhelm yourself with these tasks.</ul>

	<ul><b>Testing.</b> This sounds super weird, right? Why make extra work for yourself? Well, there's a couple <i>really</i> good reasons. For one, this could save you a lot of time (and headache) in the future. So catch your mistakes as you make them instead of building on a giant bug. And, to combat your fatigue, tests are relatively bite-sized and can add that sort of instant gratification and gamification you thrive off.</ul>

	<ul><b>Write it out.</b> There are projects that I know I can do, but also don't want to spend a hour or two writing it out and getting frustrated at a small misspelling. So, I've been writing out what to do instead in plain English. No skipping steps though. For me, I'm more interested in the design process and thorough understanding than I am with a finished project. I want to learn, not fill my GitHub with cute yet totally meaningless projects.</ul>
