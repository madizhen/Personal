	A few months ago, I started a small (though in retrospect enormous) project to map out my childhood in OpenStreetMap. Like many great ideas, it started off daily and passionate, then became weekly, then monthly maybe, and finally forgotten... until now. My plan was solid. Every day I would run the dogs down a street that I planned to map. But it wasn't before long that I didn't feel like I was contributing much. I did my elementary, middle and high school. I did my street and a few other places of meaning. But looking at it now, it's a fragmented visualisation of my memory. <i>This is where Max, Lance and I got slurpees every day over summer.</i> Or, <i>This is where I got sick at a game, and my dad took care of me.</i>  Or, <i>This is where my Mom would drop me off at pre-school and I would cry as she drove out the parking lot.</i> And, <i>This is where we found out my Dad's diagnosis.</i> It hurts to look at this map. It hurts to think about the friendships that are now barely acquaintanceships. It hurts to look at the places that I've been absent from these past few years. Mapping my childhood started feeling like I was trying to retrace lines that had been long erased.

	What I'm trying to explain is the conflicting emotions I have with this unfinished map. It's so difficult to continue because it hurts knowing that these places and people are part of memory and not part of my life. It's thoughts like these that make you realise that it isn't just as easy as picking up the phone or sending a quick text. When you're not there, you're not there. But the more this map begins to solidify, the more I think about how happy I am to have lived the life I have lived--how happy I am to have met the people I have met. Perhaps this progressing map ought to be understood more symbolically. Maybe my time in San Diego is unfinished. Maybe there will be more memories and life that I can one day mark on this map.

	Originally, I was going to make this post about how to edit OSM, but I'm glad it took this turn. I think that a lot of maps are missing an emotional component. We often see political or topographic maps, but that is not how we really experience a place. Yes, San Francisco has hills and yes, San Francisco is "hella" liberal. But those aren't my personal connections to the city or why I love it. I love it because of my friends, because of the times I've transversed on foot, because of my old job and because of how it makes me feel.

	I'm going to start this project again. There's so much of San Diego unmapped, and there's so much of it that I've lived. I'm putting this in writing so that I commit to it. But I think I'm going to have a post every so often that talks about place and memory in my OSM childhood project. This project will certainty be difficult, but I'm sure as much as it hurts to remember, but it hurts more to forget.
