	The ways in which a user interacts with design can be studied and recorded through cognitive science. Rather than seeing the brain as a conglomeration of neurons and synapses, cognitive science analyses conceptual processes that receive, digest and more rarely reiterate stimuli. The Model Human Processes neatly describes this phenomenal series through a set of processors. This model is particularly useful because it judges human interactions and cognitive speeds to accurately predict human behaviour. This predictability can further be scrutinised for optimisation and efficiency adjustments.

	The human info procesor involves the intake of stimuli through cognitive, perceptual or motor interactions. This action gets recorded in memory, though usually only briefly in working memory.

	<br></br>

	The perceptual processor is an optomeric way to gather information from the senses. It can be skewed by the available spatial selection. Similarly, the amount of other interruptions ought to be accounted for in pre-attention.

	<br></br>

	There are two types of memories. Working memory is immediate in conversation, can be assessed in chunks that are 7 +/- 2 characters long. In addition to brute character memorisation, there is also a task dependence that is useful in helping memories flashcards. The greater the number of interruptions, the less likely one is to remember memory that only passed through the long-term memory store.

	<br></br>

	Cognitive processes can only handle one sort of stimuli at once. The cognitive processes can only register and handle for so long. These interactions have taught the designer that memory is so poor tat it would be a longer lasting product if multiple generations had comeout.
