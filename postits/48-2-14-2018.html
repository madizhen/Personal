	When I first learned about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), it was explained to me through the example of bank accounts. I'm going to try to replicate the explanation, but while using a different example <i>object</i>. To start off, OOP is a programming paradigm (as termed throughout Medium) that allows programmers to design their programs like real-world objects. This is useful because of its comprehensiveness and code flexibility.

	<br></br>

	There are seven main concepts that a programmer ought to be familiar with in order to fully understand and apply OOP. This includes classes, objects, methods, encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance.

	<br></br>

	Classes initialise OOP as they provide a format, or blueprint, for the creation of the object and its functionality. The class itself is not the object, it's just <i>how</i> the object's initialisation and blueprinting. If you were to begin a class for a phone, the instructions for  the phone is not actually the phone.

	<br></br>

	Once the instructions have been followed, objects are created. These are the conceivable objects of OOP. You know something is or can be an object when an "is-a" relationship is true. For example, a an iPhone "is-a" phone. A singular iPhone is a single instance of this object. Objects can have multiple instances the way one person or company can have multiple phones.

	<br></br>

	Methods provide communication between the user and the program's object. Continuing the example, this includes the touchscreen, home and volume buttons and Siri.

	<br></br>

	Abstraction is a form of conceptual layering. Aristotle's Allegory of the Cave is frequented as the example for explaining abstraction. The gist is that people who have never been above ground are shown shadows of objects, and that is what they learn to be the objects of the surface. But what they are taught is no the actual object. Rather, they learn have learned through a different communication. In the running example, it goes the same: most users are unaware of the mechanics behind the screen or the "chip" inside of cellulars, but are certainty comfortable with using the various methods (apps, button presses, etc) to use the object.

	<br></br>

	Encapsulated is the protection of an object's parts from mechanical damage. Thus, these parts of the code are non-accessible to irrelevant parts. An iPhone is especially encapsulated, as  no inner parts of the phone could be accessed by the user without undoing several layers of screws. If a user were to access that part of the phone, it would likely break.

	<br></br>

	Polymorphism deals with the object's interaction with inputs. An object or method can exist and do perform different functions depending on whatever the input is. Polymorphic objects are also subject to the environment in which they exist. An iPhone can be used as a cellular phone and it can also be used as a weak hammer depending on the user's need and skill level. A singular application can be polymorphic in that the Phone application beholds a contact list, a call log and a dial pad depending on the input that calls it.

	<br></br>

	Inheritance allows a program to know to do things that have already been done. With the blueprint, it can make another but add new or different properties and methods. Each generation iPhone has inherited from each other. This can be seen through its UI and physical design.
