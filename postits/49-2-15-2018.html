	"Madison? That's an American name--why do you have it? Were you born here?" This is among one of the least attractive and borderline offensive series of questions that a recruiter could ask a potential recruit. I can't even tell you the name of the architecture firm, I was so taken aback that my name was perceived to be "normal" in comparison towards my "exotic" appearance. If he'd bothered to have glanced at my resume, he'd likely have been even more puzzled.

	<br></br>

	If a firm is comfortable sending out a recruiter who is unfamiliar with people of a different background, then that tells me a lot about the firm. Either there is a huge lack of diversity in their firm, or perhaps they're actively seeking people of a similar archtype. Both cases are extremely distasteful to me as a women of colour.

	The necessity for diversity in firms has been questioned and debated. Those who have traditionally been the sort of people to work in these prestigious positions are hesitant to welcome an influx of people who are different as a territorial defense. While their stance is contrary to my goals, I understand why this makes them anxious. Simultaneously, the argument for diversity--especially in creative work--believes that diversity is the key to innovation. Whether the diversity is specifically racial is certainty unclaimed. 
	I recognise that diversity can exist in other realms of socio-economic, LGBT or gender differences. But I think it should be equally recognised that an entire cultural difference provides a multi-dimensional perspective.

	<br></br>

	I'm choosing not to be upset that there are some people and firms that still have traditional views and employees. While there has been progression in many sectors, the transition to equality is a damn marathon. Instead of pursing firms who exhibit reservations towards diversity, I'm going to seek firms don't just claim to be EOE, but those who actively seek to recruit diverse backgrounds and value people for a combination of their merit and their difference.
