	I'll be honest, I was a little bored with programming at first. I was bored because I didn't care, or I at least didn't know what there was to care about. I felt like I was just learning how to rewrite basic math or was working on abstract things like linked lists that I didn't yet appreciate. Something I always wondered was: what is the point? For some people, that might have been fascinating. Though it is now, I can udnerstand why it isn't at first. Even if you haven't encountered this feeling, I'm sure you've come across a time of frusteration while programming. If you haven't, you've got to work harder. So let's talk about two types motivation when it comes to coding.

	<ul><b>Testing.</b> The gamification of coding is likely a huge driver for a lot of programmers. Testing is also important because it allows you to "test" parts of your code before writing all of it and having to fix things alter on. Testing can particularily tedious if you've got a lot of work to do, but the checkpointing may allow you to save a lot of time in the future. I'll go over how to write tests in a later post.</ul>
	<ul><b>Ambition.</b> We code in order to create programs. We create programs for functionality, efficiency, entertainment and data-comprehension. We create programs for business and prosperity. Though this sort of motivation tactic isn't something that can be coded, it is extremely effective. Is your goal to learn? Is your goal to land a job? Why not both? I set bite-sized goals for myself so that they're actually accomplishable and nothing seems too daunting.</ul>
