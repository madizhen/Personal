	Today I spent a solid three hours or so pre-coding. By pre-cording, I meant designing the program in all that it is <i>going</i> to be, not all that it is. I now have a very detailed plan of my code that is a literal English translation of code. Classes, objects and methods are written out. Abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance concepts are applied through my written attempt.

	<br></br>

	I'm writing a post about this because this is the first time that I've written a project out completely. Usually I go back and forth because I'm continually refining what I want to do. But this project's goals were explicit: create a lite version control system similar to git, but local and lighter. This was great because it allowed to think critically about a tool I use daily. They say you never really know something until you teach it to someone else. While I haven't had to explain my thought process yet, I'm going to continue this writing stage over the next few days so that I can explain exactly what's going on. I have some gracious friends (namely Eric and Nerissa!!) who are helping me expand my knowledge and courage with coding.

	<br></br>

	Before I even opened my text editor, Eric suggested to me that I spend hours--days even--writing out what I was going to do before I did it because it would save hours of debugging and on-the-fly programming. At first I thought he was crazy and that approach would set my timeline back. But if I really think about it, that's the exact approach my UI professor is trying to drill into our heads. And, out of all the papers I've had to write for college, I've never written it without out writing an extensive outline or quote bucket written out and constantly taking up at least half of my 13 inch screen. That's just how important it was for me to know where I was and where I was going. The same holds true with this write-up design for code.

	<br></br>

	While doing this, I had to think of the global and micro-scale throughout. <i>Is this action more related to this or that?</i> Or, <i>Wait, if this variable is in this method, but needs to be accessed by this other one...how am I gonna do that in Java?</i> The list of questions continued. In fact, I have the word ASK written all over the file too because I'm not sure what the best idea is. I know what I've got is wrong and probably wouldn't even make sense once translated into code, but at least I was able to construe the purpose in a conceivable way. The point of designing this project wasn't to be right, it was for me to think about object-oriented programming, delve deeper into Java and ultimately begin my first step in going through the iterative design process with code.

	<br></br>

	As this write up goes through various iterations, I'll be updating it along the way in order to record my progress in thinking, refinement and eventually code. You can find my design and code for this project a<a href="https://github.com/mzdraper/gitlite">here</a>.
