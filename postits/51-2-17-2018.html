	Halfway there! This is the 51st post since the beginning of this 100 days of posting. A short reflection before I talk about tech. I think this experience so far has been very enjoyable. It's interesting to hear where I was just a few weeks ago to where I am now. It definitely makes forgetting harder and motivation evergreen. Like I mentioned somewhere in an earlier post, I'd really like to try 100 Days of Code. Whenever I start to attempt to do so, I do think there's some things I've learned so far that would be beneficial. It took me like 17 posts before I started checking to see if I spelled words right or not--I just typed. I also read a lot of broken promises: to show you my awesome Android app, the create a follow along of jQuery, etc. I think the next time I do a large challenge like this, I'll definitely start to writing a large outline as not to cause burnout, topic fatigue and to learn more.

	Today I took a break from my typical coding routine of going through more JavaScript and Java materials, and I decided to try something new. I did this in part because it's always great to expand horizons, but I'll be honest in saying I wanted something more tangible. I didn't just want to see static pages or console outputs. I wanted to animation and whole new level of interactivity. Today, I tackled Unity, and I almost loved it.

	Unity s a heavyweight game engine for 2D and 3D games. Since Unity was announced just over twelve years ago at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference, it has grown from being supported just on iOS systems to twenty-seven different platforms. Some examples include Mac, Windows, Linux, WebGL, Playstation systems, Xbox, some Nintendo systems, just to name a few. Some of the popular games that have been created on it include Temple Run, Plauge Inc., Tiger Woods, Family Guy, Slender Man, Cypher, Sonic, Angry Birds, the list goes on. The software is full of built-in features, a market of plugins, an increasingly recognisable layout and a bunch of other features I have yet to learn. It allows for scripting to be written in C#--another caveat of today.

	I started looking into Unity because I think there's a lot of potential with mapping and Unity. I've seen tweets of people using real map data to create games, but I'm interested in what Unity can do to with real world map data. I certainty don't have an answer yet as to what it could do. (I'll I've built so far is a frog that jumps away from me). But I look forward to working on this side-project and hopefully start working on real map data.
