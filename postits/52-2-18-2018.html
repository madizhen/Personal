	Earlier today, my friend came over and I asked him to look at my code. I told him I was stuck on a couple parts and didn't know how to translate it into code. He looked at me, then deleted everything. "Just kidding," he said and pressed "cmd+z." You'd think it'd give me a mini-heart attack, but for some reason that was exactly what I was expecting. I knew I was wrong; in fact, I expected to completely have to redo everything. I might have been slightly more surprised that he brought it all back. This is something I'm still learning, and I would much rather learn what my friends have to teach than try to fight my position.

	I think it's important that a person--when learning especially--embraces their humility. There's so much value in letting go of your ego and giving room to learn. I started a pretty big project the other day and wrote out a nearly complete design for it. Today, another friend read the first method and completely destroyed what I wrote. We then focused on how to architect this program in a way that had compatible data structures. This process was thought provoking and difficult. In the time it took me to write the design for the whole project, her and I went through maybe 3 functions. As aggravating as it was and for every single time I was wrong, I felt like I learned twice as much. For as much as I've been coding on my own, what I learned in these three hours was far more productive than I've been solo. I think for anyone who is looking to code seriously, having experienced programmers that can simultaneously explain concepts and push you is invaluable. My friend asked me about what the wrong answers for a large duration of the time to make sure I was actually understanding why that choice was wrong. She taught me Socratically and would say comments like, "I'm not sure if this is the one that's right, but we're going to try it together. If it's wrong, we can go back later." This made me feel like she also thought that it was perfectly okay--and even certainty expected--to be wrong.

	To anyone who is still relatively newer to coding like me, this might one of the most discouraging things: to learn that everything you've done is completely wrong. In fact, you weren't even close to getting the first one right. Daunting, terrifying, but most of all <i>inspiring</i>. My friend was apprehensive, too, about discouraging me or just throwing information that was far too over my head. But that's not how I saw it at all. I embraced my humility, I was happy to simply "ctl+a" everything I had so far and hit "delete" like nothing. I was inspired to keep going and learn more about how to architect this code in a way that allowed for smooth communication among all the moving parts.
