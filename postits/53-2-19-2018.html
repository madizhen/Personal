	I dug a little deeper with Unity earlier today. The frog, Ted, who was initialised the other day can now jump around and eat a fly. This sounds completely trivial, but to get to this point has taken quite a few hours. Unity seems to have a lot of barriers to entry, including a large computer usage, a complex and crowded interface and let's not forget C#. But what does this mean? Do only those with fancy laptops, C# comfortability and a lot of spare time build projects with Unity? Certainty not--I make a pretty good case in point. But what it does mean is that it will take a lot more time and perseverance than learning something else, like another language. IDEs always complicate things at the beginning because it's literally having to learn a software and what and how a whole new language works with it. Unity has a lot of moving parts that work together, but luckily you can find a project tutorial online with adequate scaffolding. If you're stuck on even what that scaffolding might look like, ideally it should already have the art and game design completed--given that you're most interested in game development. While I always think it's important to learn the fundamentals of a language before coding in it, Unity might be an exception because of the specific methods and objects that are specifically for actions within a game. So, if you're not totally comfortable with C# before you start Unity, that is perfectly okay. For now, just learn what you have to learn to get an understanding of what the program is capable of. I'll be releasing the finished game on GitHub within this week, so if you can't find an appropriate amount of scaffolding, I'll be verbose about it and supply you with as much as possible. Look out for a post named Frog or maybe Ted?
