	Before I begin Part III, I want to say that I've completely fallen in love with Unity. Writing this text tutorial series helps me remember what I tried to quickly learn, and I hope you're finding it useful too. Since it's creation, I've been working on making the game difficult and involved. Today, though, I tried to make my first set of Maps on Unity using <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-unity-sdk/docs/00-getting-started.html">Mapbox's Unity SDK</a>. Though I only had enough time to go through their tutorials, it was a great experience. I find beauty and practicality in 3D maps and spent a large portion of my day looking at what more could be done with such an incredible combination. I'll try my hand at it soon and let you know when it marterialises.

	<br></br>

	I think my posts on this are a little verbose and certainty not challenging enough. Though I originally thought of writing this for an audience that is unfamiliar with both Unity and C#, I'm thinking that this is actually probably too overwhelming since I'm not adding photos or videos--sorry! Because of that, I'll post the rest of the series more of a challenge than a do this, then that construction. This will help you learn and grow as a developer. If you are someone who is new to Unity and new to C#, shoot me a message and I'll walk you through the rest. Otherwise, I apologise for the change in pace, but you'll thank me later when you can do this on your own!

	Part III
	<i>Flies, Pickups, Spawning</i>

	<ul><b>To script the Fly's movement this, you'll first have to drag the Fly PRefab into the Hierarchy Pane. Open its Geometry Game OBject and add a component to it called FlyMovement. In this script, you'll have to create movement bu rotating the object around a point (Vector 3). Create a seralised variable called <code>private Transform center</code> to be the center that the fly rotates around. Drag the Fly into the new field. In the Start method, script flySpeed to be the speed and range of the flies' flight between 300f and 700f. The speed will be at a range otherwise it would look wildly unnatural and almost terrifying if all the flies flew in identical circles. You'll want it to move at start similar to how the frog does--or else you'll have floating flies! In the Update method, script the flies' ability to move around the center. I encourage you to try it yourself, but if it's too difficult, type in <code>transform.RotateAround (center.position, Vector3.up, flySpeed * Time.deltaTime)</code>.</ul>

	<br></br>

	<ul>Select Fly and add a component called FlyPickup. In your new script, delete the Start and Update methods, then add the <code>OnTriggerEnter</code> method that takes the argument <code>Collider other</code>. Think, if there was a collision, what would happen? How would you script the disappearance of the fly after collision?</ul>

	<br></br>

	<ul>Create a script called <code>FlyPickup</code> .A particle is indicative to a player that an action, in our case it means collision has occurred. Create a seralised, private GameObject variable called <code>pickupPrefab</code>. Create an OnTriggerEnter class that checks to see if the fly collided with the Player. If so, add pickup particles. Now, add a new script called <code>FlyParticleDesctruction</code> to the Fly Prefabs. This will break any recursion  the particles' re-emerging. In its Start method, simply write <code>Destruction (gameObject, 5f)</code>.</ul>

	<ul>Create a new game object and script called <code>FlySpawner</code>, which will spawn new flies for the game. Ifyou're stuck where to start, ask yourself what you're going to need for more flies. A reference to the prefab, amounts, ranges--what do you need? Moving on to methods, at the beginning of the game, you'll have your fly. For the Update method, ask yourself what will happen when the total number of flies is less than the minimum number of flies. In order for the game to keep going, more flies need to keep appearing. Moreover, these flies will need to be spaced out from each other for naturalness. Create the flies (and save your scene!)!.</ul>

	I hope this was far more challenging and engaging than just me telling you what to copy and where to paste. Good luck, and until tomorrow!
