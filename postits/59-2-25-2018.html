	<i>Player Health, Game State</i>

	<br></br>

	Games that are more complex count and display a player's health--or the amount of tries they have until losing the game. This game is simpler as there are no life counters, only dead or alive. This can be scripted as a boolean (bool in C#) in a new script. The player will be alive at the beginning of every game instance. There should also be a method that accounts for a player and enemy's collision that will cause the player to lose. Similar to how you programmed pickups to flies after they were eaten, do the same with the frog when collided with the enemy.

	A game state describes the object or objects at a position in the game. Our game has three game states: pre-playing, playing and post-playing. There are slight, but crucial differences between these three states. Prior to playing, craft your game in a way so the Player and Enemy cannot move. Allow the game to start once the space bar is pressed. Don't forget to add text that indicates this. You've already programmed the all movement functions and game objects, so the playing state is (mostly) done! You should have a script that activates everything at the start. Finally, the post-playing state will have text that describes what happened to the player. Additionally, have the game auto-restart after a brief few seconds. This auto-playback is a key component in getting players addicted to a game. In the same script as your game initialiser, write a game end method in it too.
