	An old friend reached out to me earlier telling me about his newfound love for mapping. He's a PhD student in Public Health at Berkeley who is researching connections and spatial complexities to "optimise infectious disease surveillance systems in conjunction with moledular diagnostics for intervention and policy development." Which I figure is a fancy way of saying that by being able to map out these diseases and independent variables alike, it is an incredible way to hone in on causes and time diseaase readiness programs and supplies. It's said the first GIS map is by John Snow, who mapped cholera outbreaks to London of 1854. Through this visual spatial recognition and the correlated points of density, he was able to realise that the disease was transmitted largely by the sharing of wells. He continued talking about how spatial studies is the future of public health. And that got me thinking: where am I trying to project my future endeavors with interests in mapping? I deeply want to be able to make applications and tools for mapping platforms. I want to make it easier so that researchers who are intelligent in one area are not hesitant towards spatialising their knowledge. Facing my own hesitation with coding, I know just how terrifying this barrier can be. That is what I want to do, and I sincerely thank my friend for reigniting that in me.
