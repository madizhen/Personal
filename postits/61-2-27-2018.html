	They say it takes sixty days to form a habit (Look at me saying "they" as if I'm wielding some greater authority!). For the past sixty days, every day I've written something and posted it on this site. It seems habitual, not bothersome or chore-like. I didn't even notice I passed the halfway mark almost two weeks ago. It's natural. For the past several months, I've been programming everyday, too. But I haven't been as routine about it, so not to make myself monotonous or bored of a drawn out pattern of information intake. But I realised parallels in my behaviour towards keeping this blog and learning more about computer science every day. My attitude towards these aren't daunting or dreading as they might have been in the beginning. For the remainder of this post, I want to talk about tangible steps I've taken towards habit forming because I know it can be difficult at first.

	<br></br>

	<ul><b>Accountability.</b> Tell someone you trust about what you're planning. It will be good to have someone talk about potential post ideas with. This is especially helpful if you're uncomfortable sharing your blog posts publicly until you gain confidence. Some people work well off negative reinforcement, if you're one of those people, also consider setting up punishments for missing an iteration. In a similar vein, if you respond well to positive reinforcement, create a reward system for yourself (a giant burrito every ten iterations!).</ul>

	<ul><b>Publicity.</b> This is similar to accountability, but on a larger, public scale. This makes all your successes (and failures) public. A good example is GitHub's streak graph/intensity map. This isn't for everyone though, especially someone just starting out. Be bold and try it out to test yourself, you can always try again later if it doesn't suit you.</ul>

	<ul><b>Time Keepers.</b> I started using an app called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hours-time-tracking/id895933956?mt=8">Hours</a> that allows me to monitor what I'm doing for however long. If I deviated from the task, I felt like I was cheating the timer because record would say I was being productive.</ul>

	<ul><b>Reminders.</b> This one is critical. Everyday at 23:00, I have a timer go off that reminds me to write my post. It's crazy how many times this saved me at the beginning of this post challenge. It's easy to get so caught up in what you're doing that priorities can be easily forgotten.</ul>

	<ul><b>Repetition.</b> I can't emphasize this one enough. It's by far the most important. You can't form habit if you're not performing the action! You don't have to be great at whatever you're doing and pump out masterpieces every time (I don't think I've ever proofread my blog. I didn't even use spell check the first 20+ posts.) The point is to be able to set aside some time for yourself each day and get your mental state focused on whatever habit your forming.</ul>

	Those are the best pieces of advice I have when habit forming. If you've got other tips, please let me know! Or, push a commit to this post to add it yourself. Happy habit forming!
