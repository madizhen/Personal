	The faculty advisor my honours senior thesis is an incredibly acclaimed, respected and self-made woman. She's the chair of the College of Environmental Design's Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning Department at UC Berkeley. I respect her tremendously and am honestly quite intimidated by her.

	I had a meeting with her earlier today. I walked in and sat down at her desk, as she sat across reading my paper with a furrowed brow. WWithout looking up, she exchanged a quick greeting with me, and I watched her eyes dark left, right and left again. We sat there in silence for a couple of minutes before she looked up from her computer and held my gaze for a second before saying, "This is great! You write so well, this piece is so interesting. It's great. I want you to write more because I want to keep reading it, it's so good!" She continued like this for the next five minutes, quoting my paper and looking delighted. At one point, she pushed up her glasses and her eyes widened as she almost-surprised-but-certifiably-pleased exclaimed, "You're smart!" <i>What the heck, am I dreaming this!?</i>

	I didn't know how to respond--I still don't! I laughed shyly and said, "Thank you," some twelve times. I'm writing this post not because I want to brag about how awesome (and relieving) this was, but because this paper is a defining summation of my college career, so obviously I'm quite nervous about its materialisation. What I'm trying to get at here is getting over Impostor Syndrome. I never thought anything I'd write would be satisfactory--let alone impressive--to my advisor. It's terrifying, giving everything into a project and letting an authority figure (especially one you regard highly) to evaluate you critically. I was prepared for her to pick out things she didn't like or refute my overly-broad claims, but that didn't happen. Instead, I'm rejuvenated with newfound confidence, support and direction. I think the thing with this sort of Impostor Syndrome is that the lack of confidence is what will really get to you. If you think your project is bad, then it will be because you won't present it with brevity or because you'll be too fixated on it being awful that you take each failure case as a project failure. It's a poisonous mentality to have when approaching any new project or project presentation. Work harder than ever, and be confident. Or, at least pretend to be confident.
