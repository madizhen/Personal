	Light allows for people to see and interact with their surroundings. In games, light's function plays the same role as the first sensory indication. Without light, games are incredibly difficult for the player to understand what is going on. When I was a kid, I played Pok√©mon a lot, and every time you entered a cave, the scene's lighting vanished. It was frustrating not knowing where I was going or what was happening (not to mention the hundreds of Zubats!). Lighting also has a dramatic effect on the game's atmosphere and emotion. Warmer tones and colder tones present very different types of feelings. The contrast between the amount of shadows versus the amount of light intensity will also convey different types of environments and associated behaviours. Lighting is a powerful tool that can dramatically change a player's experience throughout a game. Lighting allows for game functionality and for scene setting. In Unity, a popular heavyweight game engine, there are different ways to direct and adjust lighting. The following can be added to scenes in Unity by selecting the Hierarchy's Create dropdown, hovering over Lighting and selecting from the list.

	<ul><b>Point Light</b> emits light from all directions around its origin. This lighting is most useful for light bulbs that illuminate that way in the real world or for particles that fade out at the sides.</ul>

	<ul><b>Directional Light</b> can have an arbitrary position because all objects will be lit from the direction the light is facing. A common use case for this light is from window pane or sunlight.</ul>

	<ul><b>Spotlights</b> originates from a specific point in space and then illuminates in a pyramid-angled structure outwards until a certain range. This is used frequently when animating lights for a flashlights or other single directed light source.</ul>

	<ul><b>Area Light</b> can be used to emit light in a rectangular pattern.</ul>

	There are several other tools and concepts to apply to lighting. Lighting can really add a physical and emotional depth to a game, but remember that these games update several frames every second, so the balance between cost and performance will always be difficult. Fortunately, there's a solution called Global Illumination, or GI for short. GI pre-performs calculations of light and object reflection interaction prior through baking and then uses that model on static objects in the game to conserve memory and enhance performance usage. Apply GI techniques to your lighting configurations and let me know how it goes!
