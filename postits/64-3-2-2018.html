	The weekend has just begun, but it's feeling quite busy! I've been attending a conference since Thursday that's geared towards encouraging diversity in tech companies. It's really been incredible to see the amount of people and companies that are looking to increase diversity. Companies are paying extreme amounts to promote their inclusive company culture and seek members of diverse communities. I <a href="https://twitter.com/mzdraper/status/964633334306430976">recently wrote</a> about the importance of diversity in companies, essentially saying that diversity is crux in cultural as much as technical space. Without having a complex understanding of a problem and all its facets, how can a team or company expect to expand? While I did see some backlash on my tweet storm for the meritocracy argument, I couldn't help but think: diversity recruiting isn't about lowering the bar, it's about considering other dimensions of a recruit. People with less privilege and diverse backgrounds have witnessed different hardships and can often times have a more complex understanding of social structures and how power effects people.

	I attended a series of talks today about AR and VR. One of which was particularity important. The talk was given by a woman who held a BA, MA and PhD in English. She asked us to think about the context around VR and AR development. <i>Why are we doing this? Why does this technology serve? Shouldn't you be more afraid of artificial idiocy than artificial intelligence?</i> Even in a tech-focused conference, a talk was given about how to design tech in a way that allows it to be accessible to different types of people. Context matters.
