	Earlier today, a recruiter said they ask all their applicants, "What's something you've learned recently?" They emphasized learning that was beyond technical skills--something more empathetic. I've been trying to think of what I'd talk about if ever asked. <i>Sustainable food systems? That relates to people worldwide!</i> or what about <i>Playing the cello? Music is a great way to self-express!</i> But those answers didn't feel right. They feel impersonal, like they weren't really answering the question--a superficial answer to a question that could be leagues deep. I'm not sure if this is appropriate to tell a recruiter, but the most important lesson I've learned recently is multi-faceted. I learned how to be a good caretaker. I learned how to take care of a dying person and those around them. I learned how to be strong even when I'm not. I learned about sacrifice. I learned how to be an advocate against doctors. I learned about life. I learned about death. I learned about cancer. I learned how the body works and what happens when it doesn't. I learned about time. I learned about limited time. I learned about value. I learned how to value. I learned how to mediate family. I learned; I learned; I learned. I learned so much beyond these simple sentences. These lessons can't be taught, only learned. While this topic might not be the most appropriate for a recruiter, I think they are among the most important lessons I will ever learn.
