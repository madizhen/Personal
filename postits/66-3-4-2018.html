	Hello, I have someone I'd like you to meet. We've known each other since I was a little kid, but I wouldn't say we're exactly friends. He comes and goes throughout my life, but I've noticed him wanting to hanging out more often. His name is Guilt.

	<br></br>

	When we were kids, he used to be shy--only staying for short periods. Like he was just dropping off letter. Now, he talks to me a lot; instead of hanging me written letters, he recites me everything to me. The way he talks to me is different now, too, he's meaner. He used to tell me what was awful in the world, so that when he wasn't around, everything would be okay. He said those check-ins were his way of protecting me. And now he reprimands about what's awful in me. He demands to know why I haven't done anything to change, claims he warned me as a child. <i>I told you, Madison. Why, why didn't you listen to me? I gave you the world, and you couldn't even try to do something about it, could you?</i> He doesn't yell at me, but he doesn't need to, not with that tone of voice anyway.

	<br></br>

	Despite our difficult relationship, I let Guilt move in recently. It's been raining lately, and I couldn't help but feel guilty leaving him out--ironically. But he's a nightmare of a roommate. He eats my food and leaves dishes in the sink, the same way he scolds me for not working hard enough. He never makes his bed, and makes sure to tell me I'll never make anything of myself. He invites his friends over for drinking on weeknights, Anxiety, Depression and Pressure are his favourite drinking buddies. He leaves the door unlocked, making sure I never feel secure.

	<br></br>

	Now you might be wondering why I don't just evict Guilt. I've tried talking to him about these things, yet he simply reminds me that I've lead myself here. <i>This is all your fault, Madison. I told you, you knew better. I told you, Madison.</i> How could I ever forget? Ever since he moved in, I think he likes it more when I fail. He says it makes me even more appreciative. I think he's wrong. So what should I do? He's too smooth a talker, and I'm a terrible shot. I don't even feel like I can let him go. Guilt says it's healthy to remember failures because it makes you more grateful for your successes. He told me that ever since I was a little kid, and to some extent, I think he's right.

	<br></br>

	I can't let go of Guilt. But I think it's important we invite someone new in. I've been looking around, and I found someone. She's clean, nice, patient and understanding. I like her. Her name is Empathy. The three of us will learn to live together. It won't be easy, and we may get in fights. But I think it's going to take a balance among all of us to appreciate and enjoy life.
