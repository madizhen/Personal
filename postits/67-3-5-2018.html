	I've spent <i>a lot</i> of time teaching myself how to code and adjacent computer science concepts. But I still don't feel like I've done as much as I could have, like I haven't built as much as I should have. Hindsight always makes people think they could have done so much more, but this project-based and result-driven work is different. I really should have more. Conceptually, I'm in love with computer science, but practically, I'm struggling. So, what to do?

	<br></br>

	I spoke earlier on doing the #100DaysOfCode challenge, and I'm getting very excited to starting it. I don't think it's a good idea to do it while also doing this 100 blog posts, but I should prepare more for it. One of Alexander Kallaway's largest requirements for the #100DaysOfCode is to post it publicly. Because of which, I'm going to write out my game plan to prepare it. <a href="https://mzdraper.github.io/postits/44-2-10-2018.html">Here's</a> a list of resources I use, and <a href="https://mzdraper.github.io/postits/39-2-05-2018.html">here's</a> my typical schedule.

	<br></br>

	For the next 30-odd days, I'm going to do the following every day in preparation of #100DaysOfCode:

	<br></br>

	&emsp; Complete two Treehouse lessons <br>
	&emsp; Watch one UC Berkeley lecture <br>
	&emsp; Read two articles about coding <br>
	&emsp; Listen to one CodeNewbie podcast

	<br></br>

	It isn't a very long to-do list, but the amount of time will be a few hours every day. I feel like I've spent too many posts writing about what I'm doing and not enough about what I've been learning. So, I'm writing. I'm writing this because I'm going to hold myself accountable. I'm writing this because I want to work on myself. I'm writing this because keeping a record is important, just wait and see my progress!
