	I've been writing a lot today in preparation to meet my faculty advisor tomorrow. My thesis is just shy of 30 pages at this point, but it has to reach 50 by next week. I'm blessed and thrilled my advisors are both so well versed on the topic and related disciplines that we can all talk about it at great length. But when it comes to writing, I'm really writing this myself. The craft of writing is a unique action that has been explained at great lengths by scholarly and renown authors, so I won't reiterate their words. However, I do think the thought process and practice of writing can be applied elsewhere. For example, I've been trying to think about how to relate my background in expository writing in application of program writing. Here's a short list of tools and practices that I value from the writing process and carry over to programming.

	<ul><b>Research and outlining.</b> This might seem intuitive, but the ratio I try to spend on just contemplate another perspective or tune exactly what I'm trying to say to the amount of time I'm writing is probably around an 80% to 20% ratio. The more time that is put into understanding and self-debating materials, the easier it will be to express and implement.</ul>

	<ul><b>Logging.</b> This concept might actually be more popular in programming--logging success and errors. But I like to write essays with my screen split in half: one side is my essay, one side is my log of a makeshift outline, smart sounding words I want to use and quotes to integrate. This layout helps me understand where I am, what I'm using and where I should be going. It's a little different than what programmers know as logging, but I think this half-screen tactic is useful in constantly remembering the problem juxtaposed to the goal.</ul>

	<ul><b>Talking it out.</b> Without guilt, I will try to tell anyone willing to listen about my writing for a few reasons. First, I think best when I have that sort of pressure to articulate so someone else understands. Countless times I've rambled myself into some of my best ideas. More importantly, getting feedback from another person is invaluable. Writing is a solo sport, and it's easy to continue validating what you already <i>think</i> you know. But when you're being hard pressed to explain your logic more carefully to someone who is unfamiliar with your topic, then it will become so much harder. This clarification process will also help the legibility of whatever your writing, be it an exposition or a program.</ul>

	<ul><b>Rapid drafting.</b> Another reason why I spend such a small time on writing is because I just write whatever is coming to mind. Don't worry about what you're saying or how you're saying it. There will be syntactical issues, there will be bugs. But it's important to sit down and just get to writing because it is so easy to distract yourself.</ul>

	<br></br>

	This is a short list of tactics I practice in writing and will continue to implement in coding. I hope you found them useful too! I think there's great value in being able to meld disciplines and their mannerisms. Human behaviour is not as compartmentalised as we have structured our education and self-identifiers. This necessity for intersectionality and overlap of disciplines will always be something I will advocate for.

	Here's my list! On the right is how many times I completed the task, on the left side is the minimum number of times I've set for myself to complete the task in a given day.
