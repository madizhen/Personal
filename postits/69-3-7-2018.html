	Yesterday, I started working on coding challenges on HackerRank. The scripting challenges remind me of freshmen lab assignments. The familiarity gave me an understanding of what I was doing and how to do so. But the amount of documentation and style of writing was very different. Let me explain one of the challenges I worked through this today.

	<br></br>

	<b>Stone Game</b>

	<br></br>

	In this game, there are two players that alternate turns with Player 1 always starting. During each turn, a player collects either 2, 3 or 5 stones. For simplicity, the game is played optimally, not strategically. If there are 2 stones, then Player 1 will collect the two and there will be no stones left for Player 2, so Player 2 loses. If there are 9 stones, then Player 1 will collect 5 stones, Player 2 collects 2 stones, then Player 1 will collect the last 2 stones. Player 2 then loses the game.

	<br></br>

	The part of the pattern to focus on is the minimum collection of 2 and maximum collection of 5. Imagine there are <i>n</i> stones. If a player is to collect 5 and have a remainder of 2, then <i>x</i> is 7. Because the turn alternation is stationary, this algorithm can be scripted around the number 7. If <code>n % 7 == 0 || n % 7 == 1</code>, then Player 2 will win. If the remainder is any other number, then Player 1 will win.

	<br></br>

	If the scripting didn't make much sense, that's okay! It took me a while to figure out the point of the game; I took a step back. I got a pen and paper, and I wrote out the given documentation in my own words and made some test cases. Try your best, try different strategies and have fun!
