	The actual magnitude of the location is astronomical compared to the map, so let's take a post (likely more) to appreciate the enormousness of Earth and our graticule measurement system.

	<br></br>

	<ul><b>Geoid.</b> The shape of Earth is not perfectly spherical or ellipsoid, and it's certaintly not flat. Earth is best described as a geoid, simply defined as an "earth-shaped-figure." If that sounds really arbritrary, it's because it is. Earth isn't flat and it's also not constant. This is explained because of tectonic activity, where some plates subjugate under others. This movement causes phenomena like earthquakes, mountain formation and continental drift. This textured appearance can be extremely difficult to replicate on a map or model, especially because of its change (though the change happens in geologic time). Depending on the purpose of the map, cartographers ought to consider what is more important: topography or political boundary. This shape is unlike any other, so the way it is projected is a simplified version for comprehension and efficiency.</ul>

	<ul><b>Latitude and Longitude.</b> Because of Earth's relatively geoid shape, there is no end and no beginning. Thus, the axis, where the ends reside at the same spots on the north and south poles, has become the reference points for measurement. The Equator, or Great Circle, is another reference point at the middle of Earth, splitting the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The Equator measures 0 degrees Latitude, and the poles measure 90 degrees Latitude. Latitude lines are the horizontal ones wrapped around the Earth. (In the fifth grade, the only projections I ever saw were either the Mercator Projection or the Robinson Projection. Both projections have the width as larger than the height, so my way of remembering was <i>Lat</i>itude is <i>Fat</i>itude because I thought the Earth was so fat.) Non-equatorial lines can also be described as parallels; but parallels are not synonymous with lines of Latitude, for they can also be descritions for lines of longitude. At first, countries or nation-states would have the main reference line for longitude pass through their capital, but you can tell that that would become extremely difficult with any degree of globalisation. In 1844, the International Meridian Conference established the reference longitude line to intersect through Greenwich, England, called the Prime Meridian. Meridians are a series of north-south lines that conjoin at the poles and form 90 degree angles with the lines of latitudes on the way. Similar to above, meridians are not synonymous to lines of longitide. Together this system of latitudes and longitudes, parallels and meridians is the graticule.</ul>

	<ul><b>Distance.</b> Creating a severely scaled down model (globe) is the only way to accurately concieve of the distance, as it's impossible to replicate true size. The measurement system for distance on the globe is by nautical mile, defined as one minutes of arc on a great circle of a sphere that has the same surface area as the Earth. The number of minutes between the two points can be found by comparing the distance to the same distance on the Equator of a globe.</ul>

	<ul><b>Direction.</b> Direction on a geoid is also difficult because of the lack of either beginning or end. So on a global scale, direction is the position of a point on Earth relative to another point. It can be measured by the angle between a reference line and the shortest line that can be drawn between the point of interest and the point of observation. Direction is stated as azimuth, or the angle measured clockwise from the reference line. The compass directions we tend to be more familiar with are loxodrome or rhumb lines when they are constant.</ul>

	<ul><b>Other Grids.</b> Other systems may be used for scaling purposes. The United STates uses the State Plane Coordiante System because it's scaled down to the size of the country and best follows the political boundaries of the states. The Universal Transverse Mercator Coordinate System was developed by the U.S. Army to pinpoint locations.</ul>

	Thematic mappers or small-scape cartographers typically don't have to concern themselves with these conversions and irregularities to the surface topography. However, geodists, land surveyors, GIS specialists and topographic cartographers ought to have some obsession with these concepts and how to apply them accurately and efficiently.
