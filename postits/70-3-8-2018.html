	I started making themed, or palette, maps during my spare time! Mapbox has a useful tool called <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/cartogram/">Cartogram</a> that captures some of the main colours in any image I upload. I tend not to use the given colour scheme or even the given colours. But it does allow me to quickly change the colours of the map within seconds. It's specifically helpful when images I use have palettes on them, so I don't have to estimate the colours.

	<br></br>

	After getting the colours more or less where I want, I export the cartogram draft to <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/studio/">Mapbox Studio</a>. The next steps I take are fine tuning the colour schemes and change the fonts. When making these edits, test how the map looks at different zoom levels. Sometimes colours overwhelm the others; some fonts will require higher tracking. The more you play around with the editor, the more comfortable you'll start to feel. If it's your first time, don't worry; I know how overwhelming it looks. A useful trick is that if you can't find something in the editor, just click on it in the map editor and you'll see a pop-up. Mapbox uses labels instead of icons (@ you esri) to help navigate you. However, be cautious if you're mapping an unfamiliar area because classifications of "major" and "minor" can seem arbitrary in unchartered land. Good luck, and have fun! If you need inspiration about what kind of palettes to make, you could likely google a popular movie's name and "palette" or you, if you're into Pokémon, check out <a href="https://imgur.com/a/lHVGx">this awesome list</a>!

	Here's a couple of examples of maps I've made recently! <br>
