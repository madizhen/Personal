	A couple of Mapbox employees came to UC Berkeley's Geospatial Innovation Facility (GIF) Lab today to teach a workshop about Mapbox Studio and Mapbox GL JS. They introduced Mapbox's usage cases and some SDKs. After that, the workshop began! We were walked through tilesets data uploading and Mapbox Studio. This involved adding and styling a data layer, then appropriately truncating the data. Adjustments could be made to the map accordingly in order to compliment the aesthetics. Once the base maps and data have been styled, they taught how to make the map into a web page using JS Fiddle. The next step was to add interactivity to the map using with mouse hovers.

	This three hour workshop was certainty much more involved than their online tutorials because they were able to respond to the varying levels of JavaScript understanding. Because of this, the next handful of my posts will be tutorials about how to use Mapbox Studio and Mapbox GL JS that will be for absolute beginners. This means that I'm going to explain how every part of it works. Expect them to be long, but hopefully they will be just as useful for those who have never even seen code before!
