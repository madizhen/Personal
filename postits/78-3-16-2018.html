	Maps are inherently subjective projections. Why are maps far out views, and why are the continents ordered as such? This is not a bird’s eye view, it is more than that: God’s eye view with Europe centered and proportionally larger than its geographic reality. With this foundational skew, how are spaces, places or territories supposed to be trustfully accurate? In short, they are not. Geography entertains the idea that space and place are not mutually exclusive, nor mutually inclusive. Space is a concept neither “entirely objective [n]or subjective” and is represented in several forms, both tangible and conceptual: urban space, digital space, outer space, etc (Gould). Place differentiates itself through lived experiences “specific to the individual and [are] time dependent” (Goodchild). However, these two concepts can be the same physical area, but with different perceptions identifying respectfully important attributes. These two concepts can be illustrated onto the theories of territory. The defining characteristics of a state require power to control its inhabitants and power to be recognized by other areas. There exist states that claim their authority, but are not powerful enough to be recognized by elsewhere. In example, Taiwan has power and distinguishes itself as a separate state; however, China holds power over it so it is not recognized as an independent nation to other countries. Exchanges of power stem from a long and complex history between the people. These territorial boundaries range from structural political states established by authority to streets occupied by gangs through fear. These concepts combine onto maps that are dually complex yet simple and accurate yet inaccurate. Due to the lived experiences present in both conceptions of space v. place and the notion of territory and boundaries, their interconnectivity can dually be projected onto maps that are ambiguously compiled by a combination of asserted authority and subjective interpretation of data.
