	About a week ago, Mapbox came out with a couple of <a hef="https://www.mapbox.com/help/interactive-tools/">Interactive Tools</a>. They nicknamed them "Playgrounds" to help people learn hands on. So far there are two kinds of Playgrounds for people to work with: Marker and Static.

	<br></br>

	<a href="https://www.mapbox.com/help/marker-playground/">Marker Playground</a> allows the user to mark an image to the map, then view the code that allowed it to recreate the code for a web app, iOS or Android mobile app or React Native platform. The first you'll do is select which you're building for. If you're coding for iOS, both Swift and Objective-C are supported. In the next step, you'll place the markers where you'd like on the map; this can be done either manually or through coordinate positions. Be mindful that you can only place one marker. You may also change the style, center the map and adjust the zoom level. Finally, generate your stater code! It will generate the code for you to copy to your clipboard or to test our in JSBin. If you feel like you want to reposition your marker, you can hit edit if you return to Step 2.

	<br></br>

	<a href="https://www.mapbox.com/help/static-api-playground/">Static API Playground</a> allows you to generate an image by specifying the map style, coordinates, zoom level, image size and more. Add your access token, then change the style. You can adjust the width and height (<a href="https://blog.mapbox.com/custom-iphone-wallpaper-maps-403acf5c8e0b">many have been using this to make phone backgrounds!</a>). Retina image quality is supported.
