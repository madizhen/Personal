	In an earlier post, we went over Earth's graticule. In this post, we'll cover how that system transforms from a spherical model to a planar projection. <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/e1/8a/b3/e18ab312aaeeccf99bdddb39193a8d2a.jpg">Spheres cannot be flattened into a smooth plane.</a> There are hundreds of projections that people have mathed out, but don't let rthe large number fool you. Projections cannot just be drawn, rather it takes a systematic and orderly process to concieve of a relatively accurate projection. Although globes are arguably more accurate interpretations of Earth, maps have alterior benefits that might oughtweigh the distortions. For example, globes are limited in their physical size, while they show small scale areas like countries and vegetation zones, maps do a much better job of navigation for roads and towns. There is no single best projection, rather choosing a projection that works best for your map will depend on your scale and theme. All projections have distortions, but they also keep some geometric properties.

	<ul><b>Equivilent.</b> A uniform area scale is maintained on equal-area projections. The projections are stretched along both sides of the maps, which creates distortion in shape.</ul>

	<ul><b>Conformal.</b> These have two conditions: the parallels and meridians must corss each other at 90 degree angles and the scale must be the same in all directions of a point. Also known as orthomorphic projections, these are known to keep the true shape of land masses. Though this communicated incorrectly. The shapes of small areas like bays and peninsulas retain their shape, but large land masses don't because this projection perserves infinitely small angles. These maps are notably flawed in their distortion of area of land masses relative to each other.</ul>

	<ul><b>Equidistant.</b> These projections retain distance between areas along certain lines or along certain points, but not the entire map.</ul>

	<ul><b>Azimuthal.</b> These projections display the azimuths correctly; however, they are only correct from a single point, the center or zenith. </ul>

	<ul><b>Compromise.</b> Also referred to as minimum error projections, these projections are actually erroneous in several aspects, but are able to maintain a consistency because of such. The angles are not right, but the shape isn't too distorted; they are not equal, nor are they poorly represented. This projection is best for thematic mapping.</ul>

	In a later post we'll discuss more specific types of projections and how to select one for your work.
