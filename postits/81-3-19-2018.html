	I got an interview with my dream company! I'm so excited! It isn't a final round interview or anything, but this is still so, so amazing. I've been stressing out like crazy about the lack of employment and so many other companies have been dormant or rejecting. So when the dream company and the dream team reached back to me, I'm definitely excited! It sort of feels like <i>Wow, they recognise my effort and are giving me a chance</i>. I think that's what I'm most happy about: getting that chance. I put a lot of effort into getting this company's attention, and I guess it worked! For me as much as for you, here's how (I think) I got the interview and my game plan to prepare for it.

	<br></br>

	I first had the privilege to <b>attend a diversity-focused career conference and fair</b>. This allowed me to talk and meet some people. This is probably my least favourite way to connect with companies, but I got a lot of business cards and met some companies that I wouldn't have known about.

	<br></br>

	From there, I <b>e-mailed everyone I thought was relevant to my employment goals</b>. Not just everyone that I met--that'd be overkill for me and them. If you don't have personal e-mails, try adding the recruiters or team members on LinkedIn! The worst they can do is say "No" or not respond to you. Put yourself out there, you never know who will be there to help you out. I sent out 5 e-mails and received 1 response, but that 1 response was just the person I needed to talk to get the ball rolling. Previous to this encounter, I once asked one of their employees over Twitter for some advice, and she happily responded. Opportunity is everywhere if you're willing to take initiative!

	<br></br>

	Which leads me to the next critical event: <b>coffee chat</b>. This is a very informal meeting where you have some more freedom to talk without nearly as much pressure. (But keep some pressure there to stay sharp!). This set-up does give you a chance to better understand the company (and team) culture. Remember that you're interviewing the company just as much as they're interviewing you. Coffee chats can only be difficult because they're not as structured either. I suggest preparing at least 5 open-ended questions to ask, perhaps even try to avoid dead-end questions. If you're not sure what to ask about, brainstorm what's most important to you in a job and see if they match your mental criteria. Also, you should come knowledgeable about the company as well, so don't forget to ask questions about the trajectory or culture of the company. Treat this interview like any other, meaning don't seem like you're wasting the other person's time. Be prepared!

	<br></br>

	<i>So what's the game plan?</i>

	<br></br>

	My friends have been <b>quizzing behavioural questions</b> throughout the day. I repeat my answers in the shower just so I have polished, yet honest answers. I don't write down entire answers to avoid sounding too rehearsed. But I do try my best to attach themes and key stories.

	<br></br>

	Because this position is technical, I'm <b>reviewing <i>Cracking the Code Interview 6e</i> and studying other materials</b> I've collected. During the coffee chat, I asked the team member about was being looked for in the open role. I was given fairly explicit answers and expectations, which helped determine my course of study. Some combination of studying technical and behavioural is all I'll be doing until the interview!

	<br></br>

	While the game plan is still rather barren, I'll try to expand on it tomorrow with something I've learned from it. Thanks for reading, and good luck on any future employment endeavors you have!
