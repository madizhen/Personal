	Hello! I've been studying all day for my interview tomorrow, prepping behavioural questions and building small projects. This short will be fairly short because I'm going right back to studying afterwards. But here's a rundown of how I've been preparing.

	<br></br>

	Behavioural

		<ul>I looked up a bunch of practice questions and started charting out what I thought was relevant by event kept going building and self-reflecting. I rewrite this out more thoughtfully to force myself to articulate my ideas to someone else.</ul>

		<ul>I rehearsed with my friends. While this sounds more like "fun," my friends are tough on me. I feel a great deal of pressure when performing in front of them too, like I have to meet some arbitrary standard at this school. But anyway, this really showed me that I wasn't thinking fast enough or that I was rambling at certain areas. We also swapped answers after questions and everyone got to learn different approaches people took to questions.</ul>

	Technical

		<ul>I know they say the worst way to study for an exam is to cram, but my four years in Berkeley would argue against that. I respond particularly well to videos and lectures, so I've been listening to people discuss different parts of development.</ul>

		<ul>Building small projects is another way that really helps me learn because it allows me to apply the concepts to code. I'm working on my second project today.</ul>

		<ul>Reviewing the company's tutorials and documentation for their product is another focus.</ul>
