	I have gotten extremely lazy with these posts, just barely remembering to complete them. I'm so close to the end, but I definitely feel like I'm cheating my way through by posting mere one-sentence posts. I could throw out excuses like, "It was my roommate's birthday and then it was my birthday!" or "Oh, my god! Spring Break!" And while I kind of am, I'm going to make it up by writing thoughtful content for the remaining days (I know that's something I should be doing anyway!).

	I'm back in San Diego for the week, and I'm happy to be here. My mom is so thrilled too. My animals are so excited, you wouldn't believe. My puppy, Tapatio, actually cries if I'm not with him. Remember when I wrote a post about Tucker hurting his leg? Well, he's okay and acts normal; but he also limps and keeps it raised a fairly often. I take him on small walks and play with him to keep his spirits up, but it it's still bothering him then we'll have to take him back to the vets to see if it'll require surgery.

	When I was a little kid, I had a favourtie cousin. I thought she was hilarious and I loved to play with her. Even though she's three or four-ish years older than me and lives in Georgia, she was my favourite. I've only met her a few times in my life, all of which have been as a child/adolescent.My family would always tell me how much I loved her as a child, even though I don't remember much I guess it's true! She's coming to visit soon with her new(ish)born son. I'm excited to re-meet her as an adult and meet him for the first time!

	This post wasn't technical, nor was it really all that significant, really. But I think a lot of what I've learned from doing a post a day has been the importance of reflection and documentation, even (and often times especially) on things of a more personal nature. While this post wasn't deep or sentimental, I'm still happy to have taken the time to think and write.
