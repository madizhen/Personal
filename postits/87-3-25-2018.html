	Entire teams work on story maps the same way directing groups and writers work on storyboarding movies together. This process makes sure everyone is working on the same problem and telling the same story. The first step to problem solving is figuring out the problem. This might seem obvious, even so obvious that there's no point in writing it. Well, there is. A huge part of almost any situation is figuring out what the problem is. Sometimes it seems like nothing is even broken. You can't fix what isn't broken, but maybe you can improve it. From there, significant work can be done in communicating the problem correctly. Only after everyone has understood the context and ails of the problem can they begin to actually solve the problem. Finding where the problem exists is the next step. <i>When does this problem arise? What is going on when this problem arises?</i> Contextualization is useful in understanding the scene's constraints and user's emotions, which become useful when designing the navigation to solving a problem. The creation and discussion of a problem's story map is beneficial in figuring out the true problem and testing contexts.

	A story map is a documented step in a well planned design framework that visually explains a product's context, use case and features. It's an at-a-glance overview of what the product is and how its used. Teams work on this together to literally draw out ideas by drafting UIs and testing UX flows. This pre-programming step is particularly useful because of its emphasis on the user's interaction and experience. It helps designers and engineers find problems in practice before in programming; this is further useful because it helps make decisions about the product's design and features. The story map is a rubric vision of the product, not necessarily the final product.

	Story maps become further useful as a means to communicating to people outside of the team. When a manager asks for a progress update, showing a visualization of where you are on the story map and its context considerations will quickly convey to the listener what it is you're doing. They may even be able to help you by questioning and matching parts of the context with the product. If you're presenting this to someone in hopes of support (particularly financially), this step-by-step may be more convincing then a deck with statistics. Story maps' context and usage will put the investor in the thought process of the usage of the product instead of just looking at financial projections.
