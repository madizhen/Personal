	I realised I haven't reflected on the interview I kept talking about - oh no! That interview was pretty different, so I think I'll reflect now.

	<ul>Timing is everything.</ul>

	<ul>Be polite; people are busy. My interviewer was late, like <i>really</i> late to our scheduled call. This was the first time an interviewer was late for me, and I didn't really know what to do. I figured he was just stuck in a meeting (he was!), but I didn't have any of his contact info. I e-mailed the recruiter a polite message, who I assume immediately forwarded it to him. I kept my phone ON and stayed close to places I could take the call. This turned out to be useful because he called and I ended up running to a quiet corridor!</ul>

	<ul>Be prepared, but also not really. I was so prepared for questions I had practiced with my friends, read on blogs, rehearsed in the shower and filled out on my cheat sheet. But because my call was cut short (from > 45 minutes to < 15 minutes!), those generic questions were not asked. Instead, they cut to the chase. I suppose that cheat sheet only has to be made once and then routinely updated, but I felt like I overspent time on that instead of a more pure reflection.</ul>

	<ul>Be honest. This is a company I've interviewed for about a year ago. It's a start-up, so I sort of made up my own position last year. Things didn't work out, but I kept in touch and it sounds like they kept my file or something too. Probably because I applied for a different team, they were pretty curious about why I was applying to a different team now. This wasn't a question-answer I had prepared or even considered all that much. To me it made since because this is what interests and matches my skill level, but I could see how a company might what to investigate my intentions and estimate how likely I am to jump ship from either the team or perhaps even the company. I think my answer was sensible and sincere, plus it allowed me to elaborate on self-teaching myself how to code.</ul>

	<ul>Be thankful. I used my thank you e-mail to stress points that I didn't feel like were stressed enough during our short call. I was cautious about this because I didn't want to sound redundant. While I didn't receive a reply, I think it did at least allow me to clarify points in writing.</ul>

	Even though this interview felt abnormal, I think it went well overall! The interviewer said I'd hear back soon for next steps. I'll keep you updated!
