	What do you do when things don't go your way? I'm sad to report that my recruitment process has come to a sudden halt. I'm not going to lie to you and say tell you how much I learned and self-reflected off the bat because that'd be lying. I really thought I had a chance at this position and this company, so I got my hopes up and was thoroughly discouraged for a couple of hours. I felt really defeated. But the recruiter was incredibly nice and told me she'd be looking into their budget and let me know if they're considering expanding the team soon. I've heard from the team that they're 'always hiring', so we'll see! In the meantime, I was still given the next step of the recruitment process: the take home. I was so discouraged about everything that I couldn't think straight and was even more discouraged when I couldn't debug this quickly. I picked it up and threw it down like three times before I actually sat down and debugged it in less than 5 minutes. I usually don't let emotions get the better of me, but I guess I was pretty sad today.

	I'm typing up the reflection part of the assignment, and I'm grateful that the company still gave me the opportunity to complete this. EVen if things don't work out the way I want to soon, maybe this is just building up to a bigger pay off later on. I'll keep you updated!
