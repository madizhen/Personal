	Every projection—including globes—are deceptive projections of Earth because of their various distortions. We discussed earlier how projections can retain certain features but often at the expense of another feature's distortion. Though I don't think it's wasteful to review every projection, those resources already exist. There are many projections: Mercator, Peter's, Gnomonic, Butterfly, Conical, the list goes on for hundreds. The Mercator is the most ubiquitous of all of them, largely because Google and Google Maps adopted this as their web map medium. The controversy of this lies in what people understand as their the world. People can't comprehend the world in its entirety without a map or model. Because most people have only ever seen the Mercator Projection, many people actually believe that this is what the world looks like. They see Europe as the centre; they see Africa and Greenland as smaller. Because people hardly ever see the world for themselves—not through either cartographer's pen or an astronomer's lense, cartographers have a unique responsibility of not just representing the world to people, but often creating it many people.

	These visual tools of maps and global models make it more conceivable and even <i>real</i>. By real, I mean that it triggers sort of an object permanence effect. It's easy to not even realise that other exist when you cannot visualise it. But maps and global models create these places for people who haven't visited and legitimise them. If places aren't on the map, how else will people from afar know they even exist? For all the world knows, it doesn't. With most maps and models showing political boundaries either with colours or borders, this sort of distinction brings legitimacy to places and their respective cultures.

  Maps are incredibly powerful tools that represent and even create the world for people. As a cartographer, it's important to understand the hidden power structures, potential distortions and deceptive aspects that projections have.
