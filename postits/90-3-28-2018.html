	I spent today with my family and my animals. I didn't learn much about technical skills. But I wouldn't have given today up for anything. I think we can be too quick to give up time with loved ones for personal motives. I understand, and I've done it many times, too. But I didn't today, and I don't think I will anytime soon.
