  	Every class in Geography begins by showing a map of the phenomena the course covers; students immediately understand the conventions of the Mercator projection and thus grasp the spatial intensity quickly. But what I learned throughout my cartographic courses was that behind the ease of map legibility is a series of difficult decisions about the intricate relationship between phenomena and its context. Maps aren’t exact representations of reality, and nor should they be. Yet it’s fascinating how maps are constructors of reality for many people, as if maps held an absolute truth and were not constructed by human hand. Maps allow for people to conceive of the world as a whole, not just in the fragments of their experiences. This dichotomy inspired me to either enroll or audit nearly every cartography-related course Geography offers, where I made maps using GIS, Mapbox, Adobe, R and several web mapping platforms. Projects included topics from physical geography—ecozones and earthquakes—and human geography—BlackLivesMatter and healthcare proximities. In addition to coursework, I enjoy teaching cartography. I intern for Geography 183, where I guide students through cartographic processes and troubleshooting map software. Additionally, I run this daily blog about cartography/web mapping and code to teach people foundational programming skills and cartographic foundations. To further my passions for mapping and education, I’m seeking graduate education in GIS.
