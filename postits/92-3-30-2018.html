	One of my current projects is making an atlas of the BlackLivesMatter movement. I've made two static maps, and now I'm prepping a web map. Here's my idea so far.

	<br></br>

	Twitter Hashtag maps come out pretty frequently after social injustices, like BlackLivesMatters and Orlando. People usually make the maps by uploading a data set to Carto and hitting play. But I want to do more than that. I want to medit the basemap to speak towards the story too. I think this will help to contextualize information. Specifically, I want to make a map of the murders, protests and adjacent various Twitter Hashtags on a map basemap that follows the design of the BlackLivesMatter movement. Design is powerful. When people make maps of just the hastags, it can be used either way politically and it just segregates people and places into this hastag or that hashtag. But I think there's a deeper connection between the movement and people. And I want to find it.

	<br></br>
	
	I started editig the basemap into something that matches the movement's design principles.
	<br></br>
	Next, I'll be collecitng and cleaning data to put into a geoJSON file.
	<br></br>
	I'll create a web application that allows a user to slide and view events at their discretion instead of a GIF-like movement.
