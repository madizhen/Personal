	For all the times I've transveresed the lateral of California, I've only done so two ways: flight and automobile. Today, I drove with a old friends. We took the scenic route this time. The geomorphology of California presents itself beautifully, even when going eighty or nintey miles an hour. If you haven't tried it yet, I recommend it.
