	When a place is referred to as a center, it is typical to associate images of vibrance, density and urbanity. The city center in particular is a supposed concentration of cultural, economic and social interaction. Having a center is healthy for a city and community because it is a concentrated area that can attract and satisfy the different needs of various types of people. This area is a civic and capitalist amalgamation that seeks to service all members of the community through local government buildings, work offices, shops and restaurants. In addition to commercial use, people regard “peripheral growth [as] anathema [are] united by a psychological rather financial interest” and are drawn towards the center’s ebullience (Vance, 70). Vance subtly suggests people have a stronger affinity for who they are more than where they are, so supplying them with a central gathering place encourages interaction and relative diversity. By bringing people from opposite edges of the city, this area also fosters safe and pleasurable intermingling between citizens of similar interests who may otherwise not have met. This density also lures people of difference to come and debate their adverse beliefs, thus sharing ideas and expanding personal horizons. Frankly, the center sounds so much like a utopian fantasy that it possibly does not exist as cleanly as proclaimed. Outside of Central Business Districts’ density, perhaps city centers are even inconceivable to people. Do such places of convenience and collaboration truly exist and satisfy all people?

	Before committing to the realness of any real center of place, we ought to first delve into the word “center” itself. While such a place is conceivable to people, it may not always be the same place. A center may be relative to a person’s experience and their personal geography. When the center is arbitrarily located in geographic space, but aligned with targeted population densities, I call this the elastic view of the center; it defines the center by its density. Conversely, the definition of the center ought to consider what or who it is the center of, for a center could not exist without its edges. I call this the strict view, where the center’s location is determined by its relationship to its edges. Definitions are dynamic, meaning these views are ways of perceiving but not necessarily deciding what or where the center is. Perhaps a better way to view the center is to incorporate ideas from both points of view. A center exists in several cities as a means of ideological convergence and commercial convenience, but the center of what exactly is a question to be explored further.

	When applying the elastic and strict view of the center to cities and city centers, the two definitions present different benefits and pitfalls. In the case of many cities with topographic irregularities and sprawled edges, the city center is rarely placed at the geographic center of the region. Thus, the strict view of the center is hardly used with exact measurements. But the strict view can certainly still be applied when analysing the city center’s relative distance and accessibility from other parts of the city and satellite areas of the region. Alas, if transportation infrastructure is insufficient in certain areas, then the center automatically excludes a large portion of that population, thus limiting the amount of diversity of population and interaction. The elastic view considers emphasizes the density and prominence of convenience and commercial activity. It allows for a more personal view of the center and a means of intentional and purposeful convergence, rather than just equal travel proximity. Though this view may also present skewed problems when analysing what socioeconomic and racial groups the commercial activity is aiming to serve. When split, these two views present the city center as dichotomous and far too unlike reality. Perhaps it is best and perhaps most realistic view of the city center is presented through both lenses in order to enhance and sustain growth and investigate the parts that lack equity.

	Realistically, the city center is geographically placed based on the elastic view of the center more than the static. But there are several problems of equity and access in the intricacy of defining a center this way. Extending beyond a government’s civic duty or the marriage of capitalism and convenience, what is the purpose of a center? In Jacob’s The Economy of Cities, she persuades the economic importance of a city and how the maturation of a business is crux to the growth and development of a city (49). The growth and development of a city extends beyond economic prosperity and includes a multi-dimensionality of population diversity, public use and purpose and feasible sustainability. Diversity refers to people of various identities, including but not limited to economic status, cultural background and sexual orientation. Public places invite people to come, but adding purpose it gives people a reason to stay. A center ought to be sustainable in its own right with a constant influx of people and money, inviting people to come and giving entertaining them to stay with eateries or shops. Having a center that is monotonous and only serves one sort of people is futile, as it is missing the crucial aspect of difference. As Jacob argues in The Death and Life of Great American Cities, this ubiquity is dull and set to fail because it lacks dimension and the ability to attract diversity. While she may be addressing the entire city’s economic health, this principle can still be applied when scaled down to the center. It dually acts as a space of exclusion, segregating people via feasible routing networks and also by designing a place without a non-ubiquitous purpose. People may always find a way to get there, but a crucial part of what makes a center is the wanting to be there. Though the thought of a “space for all” is quixotic, it is necessary to at least consider other people before designing a center. The center ought to be the nexus of people and interactions—economic and social—that has materialised out of diversity, which supports various types of businesses and nurtures a community, but the implementation is often not so utopian.

	Where do these idealistic centers tangibly exist? Do they even exist? City centers are likely the closest publically conceivable places that exhibit economic, cultural, and technological opportunities and institutions—though whether or not they are attainable by various people is debatable. Many cities have civic or commercial areas called “City Center” for marketing purposes or raising the surrounding real estate values. Most places only have one area labeled City Center, so not to confuse its inhabitants and tourists. Yet there exists a region that fights for the centric title and economic prosperity that being center enjoys. This region and its inhabitants go beyond stereotypical labeling and political and self-segregation, to the point where the cities themselves fight to reign as the center. This area is known internationally as the San Francisco Bay Area, but locally just as the Bay Area to enervate the thought of San Francisco being the omnipotent central city. Though it might be construed as deceitful to use the Bay Area because its singular cities have their respective centers and CBDs, but this region will be analyzed because it is often referred to as one place and the persistent competition between the larger cities.

	Additionally, this region is contrastly more polarised in economic industries and political climates than other metropolitan areas. From software engineering to biotech to academia to product management to medical institutions to intellectual property law, many of the major careers revolve around the research, creation and deployment of technology. Though nearly any professional occupation in any city relies on technology, the difference is that in the Bay Area nearly all disciplines focus on generating technology. The political climate of the Bay Area is also fairly standard with mostly liberals or, at “worst,” libertarians. This view has extended to encourage and support the civil rights of ethnic, LGBT and economic minorities. The Bay Area is ironically monotonous in its culture, yet extremely diverse in its population; in fact, major Bay Area cities San Francisco, San Jose and Oakland have all been ranked in the top ten most diverse metros by Forbes (Kolko, Forbes), with San Jose placing first. In summary, the Bay Area is an ideal case study to examine the “center” at a regional and municipal level because of its homogenous political climate, economic focus and diverse population. This combination allows for less biases to be contended during deliberations.
