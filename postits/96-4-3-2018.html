	I've been dormant this past week and a half, but I'm starting a new project today! I'm working on making this static <a href="https://github.com/mzdraper/geog-hthesis-site/blob/master/anguishassembly.png">map</a> into a web map. Ideally, I would like to have the full project have a slider displaying when the murders and protests happened. Also, I want there to be choices of what layers of data are being displayed: murders, protests, or both.

	<br></br>

	I'll be using Mapbox Studio and Mapbox GL JS.

	<br></br>

	First, I drew up a few mockups of what I wanted the map too look up. Then, I started writing HTML code for bins. I referenced Mapbox examples while doing so.

	<br></br>

	I'm currently in the process of creating the GeoJSON files for datum. Once I complete this, I'll work on getting the slider working. Then probably a lot of debugging... And it should be done!
