	<h4>Round 1</h4>

	<br></br>

	Mapbox started a Map Madness competition in March as a way to get people making maps weekly and keep up the spirit of March Madess! While I was never a big basketball fan, I'm a huge map fan. Before the competition was even announced, I had a <a href="https://twitter.com/mzdraper/status/967817099820150784">tweet thread</a> going of maps I had made using Mapbox Studio. Mapbox set up four rounds for the event, growing increasingly more intensive with each round. The first round involved using their tool: Cartogram.

	<h5>What I did</h5>

	I had already made a Pokemon themed map with Bulbasaur, but I found a huge list of Pokemon palettes that I was eager to try. I uploaded Squirtle's palette and adjusted the colours. Next, I imported the style into Mapbox Studio to adjust more colours and change the fonts. Since I had done Bulbasaur's map already, I had fonts pre-uploaded. After a couple of minutes, I was done! While the Cartogram tool doesn't create cartograms, it is a useful tool to quickly design maps. It allows you to see how colours blend on the fly and without filtering through over 100 layers.

	<h5>What I learned</h5>

	During this challenge I learned about balancing efficiency with quality. I was able to see how to alter colour relationships quickly and understand how to translate weights of an image's palette to a different image.
