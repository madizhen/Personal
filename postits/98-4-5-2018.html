	<h5>What it was</h5>

	The second challenge in Map Madness was to put a point on a styled map with using Mapbox Studio and Mapbox GL JS.

	<h5>What I did</h5>

	I'm a giant Harry Potter nerd. I made Hogwart House themed base maps, using the colour palettes of each house. I used the fonts used on the books' covers, chapter headings and the actual text. While I did have the time to make Mauder's Map, I wanted to put Hogwarts on the map! I used <a href="">this</a> example from Mapbox's tutorials page. Then I changed the values to show where Hogwarts is in the UK. I put this on every map. Because each basemap had a different colour scheme it was difficult finding an image (used to represent the point) of Hogwarts that worked for all of them. To finish up, I commented the <a href="">code</a> extensively to explain line-by-line what the code was doing to someone unfamiliar.

	<a href="">Here's</a> a link to a tweet with screenshots of all the maps!

	<h5>What I learned</h5>

	This was actually something I was already pretty familar with, so I didn't learn a whole bunch. But! I did enjoy this exercise because it gave me the chance to think about story mapping. <i>How does the base map relate to the content? How can the content best be represented with respect to the base map?</i>
