    I was writing on Medium for a few days--okay, like 5 days--before I was over it.
    It was fast and easy to share, but it didn't feel like <i>mine</i>. I wanted something
    that felt like I made it. I looked through Gatsby, Jekyll and a lot of other cool <i>things</i>.
    But the more I looked at things and thought about it, the more I realised I just
    wanted my site to be super simple. I don't know if it was MySpace or Tumblr, but I can type
    HTML and think pretty smoothly compared to Markdown. Plus, I already had a style I liked.
    So I dusted off my old site and started restructuring a bit.

    During my last (and notably first) consistent blog, I wrote daily about evyerthing I was learning.
    In a Medium post, I said I wanted to write about how I'm growing, scaling and learning. But I think
    I'm actually going to dedicate this blog to a mixture of stuff that happens in my life: how I'm
    doing, what I'm learning, where I'm walking, when I'm thinking and who I'm becoming.
