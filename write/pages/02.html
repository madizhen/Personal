  <h3>What is CX?</h3>

  <p>
    Over the weekend, I did several hours of research on CX (customer experience) designs and workflows.
    For context, I'm a Support Engineer at Mapbox, and I've worked in other customer faving roles since
    I was a junior in high school. I created my own lexical phrases and crafted efficient workflows both
    in the restaurant and behind the computer screen. I've got customer service down. Or that's what I
    told myself before this weekend. I think what I was missing the most was how to scale and levage CX
    with business and product growth, which makes sense since the small restaurants weren't looking to
    scale the way tech companies do. Here's what I learned about.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Support Driven Growth.</b> This is an upselling tactic that works to promote another product to a user
    by either improving, compliementing and/or automating their original process and goal. This strategy is
    paired with a positive format.

    <br></br><i>"Yes! We have X, and I recommend Y."</i><br></br>

    The focus here is creating a fully positive experience for the customer. It translates to the customer
    that not only do we have what you're looking for, but we also have something else that will make it <i>better</i>.
    Better is, of course, used abtritrarily. It captialises on a danger we're all too familiar with: shopping
    without a list. I know when I go to the grocery store, I'm looking for some vegtables, but I also see
    pre-made sauces that would work to automate my process by decreasing the amount of time I have to cook
    and it has potential to improve my meal because it's scientifically proportioned.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Service Recovery Paradox.</b> The goal behind this is to turn users with bad product experiences
    into loyal customers by delivering fantastic support. While we aim for products to be streamline
    experiences for users, there are inevitable issues that could happen on either server or client side.
    To the customer, it doesn't really matter whose fault it is. They just want the issue resolved. This is
    where Support can really make a company shine by helping the user through this issue. It shows the user
    that the company wants its users to succeed and isn't egotistic about having a fullproof product.
  </p>
  <p>
    The above two are the most refined theories I read about this weekend, but defintely not the only. Other
    ideas were more particular about how, what and when to communicate. This next week I'm going to implement
    some of the tactics I learned. If I seem to get a positive response from customers, I'll synthesise the
    main points. If I get a negative response, I'll dig into it even further.
