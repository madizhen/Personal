  <h4>01.15.2019</h4>

  <p>
    My role as a Support Engineer goes far beyond product mastery. Products are updated regularly updated
    or at their environments or dependencies are at least. Either way, something is going to change at some
    point, so mastery is really an abritrary depth of knowledge. I'm not focused on the <i>what</i> nearly
    as much as I'm focused on the <i>why</i> and the <i>how</i>. I aim for understand a product throughout
    it's entire life cycle and, in turn, how that affects the customer experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've had the pleasure to work with UX researchers, designers, engineers and customers to gain a
    comprehensive understanding of the product from ideation to creation to implementation. Having developed
    a full understanding of the customer’s workflow from product to contact, I’ve been able to provide
    thorough explanations, spot and accurately bugs faster and ultimately resolve issues faster for our customers.
  </p>
  <p>
    As the customer experience is an evergreen task, I'm beginning to expand these symbiotic relationships by
    creating feedback systems with the customer's experience back to the engineering and product teams to create
    a more customer-centric product line.
