  <p>
		Yesterday, I went to Schein & Schein, an old map store in northern San Francisco. I was on the hunt for
		Sanborn maps. The shop owner had the 17 San Francisco books downstairs. I was amazed, holding the original
		maps in my hands and running a finger down to feel the gentle bumps of overlaid paper.
