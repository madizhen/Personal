  <h4>01.24.2019</h4>

  <p>
		Today was the first day of the Web Cartography course I helped Professor Cowart put together for UC Berkeley's
		Geography programme. It was just syllabus day, so we didn't get into any nifty details of mapping or shiny
		software. Having interned previously in the print map cartographic representation course Professor Cowart teaches,
		I saw a lot of familiar faces in the lab. Even though so much has changed since graduating, it was sort of nice to
		see how some things were still the same.
  </p>
	<p>
		I've created a few assignments for the course already, which involve creating a base map, taxnomy chart and a data workflow.
		But I'm most excited for the next lab assignment I'm going to write up. I spent a lot of time creating the Sanborn-ish and
		Raisz-ish maps. I think it would be a really exciting assignment for students to find a print map they map and design a
		web base map around it.
	</p>
	<p>
		I look forward to see how this course shakes out. More to report soon.
